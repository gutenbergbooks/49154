<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the humblest human life is a tale of
marvels. Dr. Johnson said that there was not a man
in the street whose biography might not be made
interesting, provided he could narrate something of his
experiences of life, his trials, his difficulties, his successes,
and his failures.</p>

<p>I use these words as an introduction to the
following biography of my “man in the street.”
Yet Thomas Edward is not an ordinary man.
Eighteen years since, I mentioned him in <i>Self-Help</i>,
as one of the most extraordinary instances of
perseverance in the cause of science that had ever
come under my notice.</p>

<p>Nor was he a man of any exalted position in society.
He was a shoemaker then; he is a shoemaker still.
For nearly thirty years he has fought the battle of
scientific poverty. He was one of those men who
lived <i>for</i> science, not <i>by</i> science. His shyness prevented
him pushing himself forward; and when he
had done his work, he was almost forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>How he pursued his love of Nature,—how he
satisfied his thirst for knowledge, in the midst of trials,
difficulties, and troubles,—not the least of which was
that of domestic poverty,—will be found related in
the following book. Indeed, it may be said of him,
that he has endured as much hardship for the cause of
science, as soldiers do in a prolonged campaign. He
spent most of his nights out of doors, amidst damp,
and wet, and cold. Men thought him mad for enduring
such risks. He himself says, “I have been
a fool to Nature all my life.”</p>

<p>He always lamented his want of books. He had
to send his “findings” to other naturalists to be
named, and he often lost them. But books could
not be had without money; and money was as
scarce with him as books. He was thus prevented
from taking rank among higher-class naturalists.
He could only work in detail; he could not generalise.
He had to be satisfied with the consolation that
Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys once gave him. “Working naturalists
like yourself,” said he, “do quite as much good
service in the cause of science as those who study
books.” Edward, however, doubted this; for he
considered works on natural science to be a great
help to the working naturalist. They informed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of what others had done, and also of what remained
to be done.</p>

<p>Those who would know something of what Edward
has accomplished in only <i>one</i> department of his
favourite subject, should consult Messrs. Bate and
Westwood’s <i>History of the British Sessile-eyed
Crustacea</i>, where his services to the cause of science
are fully and generously acknowledged. Of the
numerous Crustacea mentioned in that work, Edward
collected a hundred and seventy-seven in the Moray
Firth, of which twenty were New Species.</p>

<p>In 1866, Edward was elected an Associate of the
Linnean Society,—one of the highest honours that
science could confer upon him. Since then, however,
he has been able to do comparatively little for
the advancement of his favourite study. He had been
so battered about by falling from rocks in search of
birds, and so rheumatised by the damp, wet, and cold,
to which he was exposed at night,—for he was obliged
to carry on his investigations after his day’s work
was over,—that he was unable to continue his investigations
in Natural History.</p>

<p>In the Appendix will be found a Selection of the
Fauna of Banffshire, prepared by Edward. I have
been able to find room for only the Mammals, Birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Fishes, and Crustacea. I wish it had been possible
to give the Star-fishes (<i>Rayed Echinodermata</i>), Molluscs,
Zoophytes, and other objects; but this would
have filled up the book, and left no room for the Biography.</p>

<p>It was not my intention to have published the book
in the ornate form in which it now appears. But my
friend Mr. Reid,—being greatly interested in the man
and his story,—and having volunteered to illustrate
the work “for love,” I could not withstand his
generous offer. Hence the very fine portrait of Edward,
so exquisitely etched by Rajon; and the excellent
wood engravings of Whymper and Cooper, which
illustrate the volume.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the materials
of the book have been obtained from Edward himself,
either by written communication or by “word of
mouth.” Much of it is autobiography. Edward was
alarmed at the idea of what he communicated being
“put into a book.” He thought it might do me an
injury. “Not a copy,” he said, “would be bought
in Banff.”</p>

<p>However this may be, the writing of the Biography
has given me much pleasure. It has led me
to seek health amidst the invigorating breezes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the North; and to travel round the rugged shores of
Aberdeen and Banff, in search of the views of bays
and headlands with which Mr. Reid has so beautifully
embellished the book.</p>

<p>It may be objected—“Why write the life of a man
who is still living?” To this it may be answered, that
Edward has lived his life and done his work. With
most of us, “<i>Hic jacet</i>” is all that remains to be
added. If the book had not been written now, it
is probable that it never would have been written.
But it may be asked,—“Is the life really worth
writing?” To this question the public alone can give
the answer.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF A NATURALIST.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small><i>EARLY YEARS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Thomas Edward</span> was born at Gosport, Portsmouth,
on Christmas day, 1814. His father, John Edward,
was a private in the Fifeshire Militia. Shortly after
his enlistment at Cupar, he went to Aberdeen to join
his regiment. While stationed there, he became
acquainted with, and afterwards married, Margaret
Mitchell, a native of the place.</p>

<p>Not long after John Edward’s marriage, his regiment
was ordered to Portsmouth. Towards the
close of the continental war, militia regiments were
marched hither and thither, from one end of the
country to another. The regular troops had mostly
left England, to meet the armies of Napoleon in
the Peninsula and the Low Countries. The militia
were assembled in camps along the coast, or were
stationed in garrisons to hold watch and ward over
the French prisoners confined there. Hence the
appearance of the Fifeshire militia at Gosport, where
the subject of our story was born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VILLAGE OF KETTLE.</i></div>

<p>When the battle of Waterloo had been fought,
and peace fell upon Europe, the English army returned
from abroad. The militia were no longer needed for
garrison duty, and the greater number of them were
sent home. The Fifeshire Militia were ordered to
Fife, and took up their quarters at Cupar. During
that time, John Edward’s wife and family resided at
the village of Kettle, about six miles south-west of
the county town. They lived there, because John
was a native of the place, and had many relatives
in the village.</p>

<p>At length the militia were disembodied. Edward
returned to Kettle, and resumed his trade of a hand-loom
cotton weaver. After remaining there for some
time, he resolved to leave for Aberdeen. His wife
liked neither the place nor the people. Kettle was
a long straggling sleepy village. The people were
poor, and employment was difficult to be had. Hence
Edward did not require much persuasion to induce
him to leave Kettle and settle in Aberdeen, where
his wife would be amongst her own people, and where
he would be much more likely to find work and wages
to enable him to maintain his increasing family.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GREEN AT ABERDEEN.</i></div>

<p>Arrived at Aberdeen, John Edward and his wife
“took up house” in the Green, one of the oldest
quarters of the city. Their house stood at the head
of the Green, near Hadden’s “Woo mill.” The remains
of the old Green were lower down the hill.
The Denburn ran at the foot of the Street. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
were also the Inches, near the mouth of the Dee,
over which the tide flowed daily.</p>

<p>Since then, the appearance of that part of Aberdeen
has become entirely changed. Railways have
blotted out many of the remnants of old cities.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Green is now covered with houses, factories, and the
Aberdeen Railway Station,—its warehouses, sidings,
and station rooms. A very fine bridge has been erected
over the Green, now forming part of Union Street;
the Palace Hotel overlooking the railway station and
the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>Thomas Edward was brought up in his parents’
house in the Green, such as it was sixty years ago.
It is difficult to describe how he became a naturalist.
He himself says he could never tell. Various influences
determine the direction of a boy’s likings
and dislikings. Boys who live in the country are
usually fond of birds and bird-nesting; just as girls
who live at home are fond of dolls and doll-keeping.
But this boy had more than the ordinary tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to like living things. He wished to live amongst
them. He made pets of them; and desired to have
them constantly about him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE UNRULY CHILD.</i></div>

<p>From his birth he was difficult to manage. His
mother said of him that he was the worst child
she had ever nursed. He was never a moment at
rest. His feet and legs seemed to be set on springs.
When only about four months old, he leapt from his
mother’s arms, in the vain endeavour to catch some
flies buzzing in the window. She clutched him by
his long clothes, and saved him from falling to the
ground. He began to walk when he was scarce ten
months old, and screamed when any one ventured
to touch him. And thus he went on, observing and
examining,—as full of liking for living things as he
was when he tried to grasp the flies in the window
at Gosport.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEGINNINGS OF NATURAL HISTORY.</i></div>

<p>When afterwards asked about the origin of his
love for Natural History, he said, “I suppose it must
have originated in the same internal impulse which
prompted me to catch those flies in the window.
This unseen something—this double being, or call it
what you will—inherent in us all, whether used for
good or evil, which stimulated the unconscious babe
to get at, no doubt, the first living animals he had
ever seen, at length grew in the man into an irresistible
and unconquerable passion, and engendered in
him an insatiable longing for, and earnest desire to
be always amongst such things. This is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
reason I can give for becoming a lover of Nature. I
know of none other.”</p>

<p>While living at Kettle, the child began to walk.
He made friends with the cats and dogs about the
house. He was soon able to toddle out of doors.
At first, he wished to cultivate the acquaintance of
the cocks and hens and ducks, of which the village
was full. But they always ran away before he could
get up to them and caress them.</p>

<p>There was, however, another, and a much more
dangerous creature, whose acquaintance he sought to
make. This was a sow called Bet, with a litter of pigs.
Whenever he was missing, he was found looking in
at the pigs. He could not climb over the paling, but
could merely look through the splits.</p>

<p>The sow was known to be ferocious, and she was
most so when she had a litter of pigs. Edward’s
mother was afraid lest the sow should injure him by
biting his hands or face through the bars of the cruive.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Therefore she warned him not to go near the beast.
But her warnings were disregarded. When she asked,
“Where’s Tam?” the answer invariably was, “Oh!
he’s awa wi’ the pigs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>STOLEN BY THE GYPSIES.</i>”</div>

<p>One day the boy disappeared. Every hen-house,
every stable, every pigstye, and every likely corner
of the village, was searched; but in vain. Tom was
lost! He was then little over a year old. He
could not have gone very far. Somebody raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cry that he had been “stolen by the gipsies!” It
was remembered that some tinkers had been selling
their brooms and pans in the village that afternoon;
and it was immediately concluded that they had
kidnapped the child. It was not so very unreasonable
after all. Adam Smith, the author of the <i>Wealth
of Nations</i>, had been kidnapped by a gipsy woman
when a child at Kirkcaldy, many years before; and
such things live long in popular recollection.</p>

<p>A hue-and-cry was accordingly got up in Kettle
about the bairn that had been stolen by the gipsies.
Their camp was known to be in the neighbourhood,—about
three miles off. Tom’s uncle and three other
men volunteered to go early next morning. The neighbours
went to their homes, except two, who remained
with the mother. She sat by the fire all night,—a
long, wretched, dreary night. Early in the morning
the four men started. They found the gipsy camp,
and stated their grievance. They “wanted the child
that had been kidnapped yesterday.” “What?” said
the chief gipsy; “we never kidnap children; such
a dishonest deed has never been laid to our charge.
But, now that you are here, you had better look for
yourselves.”</p>

<p>As the searchers were passing through among the
carts and tents, they were set upon by a number of
women and girls, and belaboured with every kind of
weapon and missile. Those who had neither sticks
nor ropes, used their claws. The men were unmercifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
pummelled and scratched before they could
make their escape. They reached Kettle in a deplorable
state,—but without the child!</p>

<p>All hopes of his recovery in that quarter being
ended, another body of men prepared to set out in
another direction. But at this moment they were
amazed by a scream outside the house. All eyes were
turned to the door, when in rushed the pig-wife, and,
without the least ceremony, threw the child into his
mother’s lap. “There, woman, there’s yer bairn! but
for God’s sake keep him awa frae yon place, or he
may fare war next time.” “But whar was he?” they
exclaimed in a breath. “Whar wud he be but below
Bet and her pigs a’ nicht!”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INCHES AT ABERDEEN.</i></div>

<p>When the family removed to Aberdeen, young
Edward was in his glory. The place where he lived
was close to the outside of the town. He was enabled
to roam into the country by way of Deeside and Ferryhill.
Close at hand were the Inches,—not the Inches
of to-day—but the beautiful green Inches of sixty
years ago, covered with waving algæ. There, too,
grew the scurvy grass, and the beautiful sea daisy.
Between the Inches, were channels through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tide flowed, with numerous pots or hollows. These
were the places for bandies, eels, crabs, and worms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VENOMOUS BEASTS.</i></div>

<p>Above the Inches, the town’s manure was laid
down,—at a part now covered by the railway station.
The heaps were remarkably prolific in beetles, rats,
sparrows, and numerous kinds of flies. Then the
Denburn, at the foot of the Green, yielded no end of
horse-leeches, powets (tadpoles), frogs, and other creatures
that abound in fresh or muddy water. The boy
used daily to play at these places, and brought home
with him his “venomous beasts,” as the neighbours
called them. At first they consisted, for the most
part, of tadpoles, beetles, snails, frogs, sticklebacks, and
small green crabs (the young of the <i>Carcinus mœnas</i>);
but as he grew older, he brought home horse-leeches,
asks (newts), young rats—a nest of young rats was a
glorious prize—field mice and house mice, hedgehogs,
moles, birds, and birds’ nests of various kinds.</p>

<p>The fishes and birds were easily kept; but as there
was no secure place for the puddocks, horse-leeches,
rats, and such like,—they usually made their escape
into the adjoining houses, where they were by no
means welcome guests. The neighbours complained
of the venomous creatures which the young naturalist
was continually bringing home. The horse-leeches
crawled up their legs and stuck to them, fetching
blood; the puddocks and asks roamed about the
floors; and the beetles, moles, and rats, sought for
holes wherever they could find them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INCORRIGIBLE BOY.</i></div>

<p>The boy was expostulated with. His mother
threw out all his horse-leeches, crabs, birds, and
birds’ nests; and he was strictly forbidden to bring
such things into the house again. But it was of
no use. The next time that he went out to play,
he brought home as many of his “beasts” as before.
He was then threatened with corporal punishment.
But that very night he brought in a nest of young
rats. He was then flogged. But it did him no good.
The disease, if it might be so called, was so firmly
rooted in him, as to be entirely beyond the power of
outward appliances. And so it was found in the end.</p>

<p>Words and blows having failed to produce any
visible effect, it was determined to keep him in the
house as much as possible. His father, who was a
handloom weaver, went to his work early in the
morning, and returned late at night. His meals were
sent to him during the day. The mother, who had
her husband’s pirns to fill, besides attending to her
household work, was frequently out of the way; and
as soon as she disappeared, Tom was off to the Inches.
When any one made a remark about her negligence
in not keeping a tighter hold of the boy, her answer
was, “Weel, I canna be aye at his heels.” Sometimes
he was set to rock the cradle. But on his mother’s
arrival at home, she found the rocker had disappeared.
He was also left to play with the younger children;
but he soon left them to play by themselves.</p>

<p>He was occasionally sent a message, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
rarely fulfilled it. He went to his old haunts, regardless
of the urgency of the message. One morning he
was sent to his father’s workshop with his breakfast;
but instead of going there, he set off for the Stocket,
several miles from town, with two other loons.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Tom
induced them to accompany him. The Stocket was
a fine place for birds and birds’ nests. They searched
all day, and returned home at night. The father never
received his breakfast. It was eaten by Edward and
the loons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IMPRISONED AT HOME.</i></div>

<p>As a punishment for his various misdoings, he
was told one morning that he was to be confined to
the house all day. It was a terrible punishment, at
least to him. Only a portion of his clothes was given
him, that he might not go out; and as a further
precaution, his mother tied him firmly to the table
leg with a thick wisp of thrums. She also tied his
wrists together with a piece of cord. When she
went out on family affairs, Tom’s little sister was set
to watch him. But he disengaged himself from his
bonds almost as quickly as the Davenport brothers.
With a mixture of promises and threats, he made his
little sister come to his help; and the two together
pushed the table close to the grate, when putting the
rope which confined his legs between the ribs, it soon
burnt asunder, and he was free. He next tried to
find his clothes, but his mother had hidden them too
securely. He found a coat of his elder brother’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
much too big for himself: nevertheless he put
it on.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SETS HOUSE ON FIRE.</i></div>

<p>His mother’s feet were now heard on the stair.
Tom hid himself at the back of the door, so that
he might rush out as soon as she entered. The door
was opened, his mother rushed in screaming, and
Tom ran away. The table to which the rope had been
attached was on fire, and the house would soon have
been in a blaze. In quenching the flames of the rope
attached to the boy’s leg, he had forgotten, in his
hurry, to quench the burning of the rope still attached
to the table. Hence the fire. But Tom was now at
liberty. He soon got rid of his shackles, and spent
a glorious day out of doors. He had a warm homecoming
at night, but the less said of that the better.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AGAIN ESCAPES.</i></div>

<p>In fact, the boy was found to be thoroughly incorrigible.
He was self-willed, determined, and stubborn.
As he could not be kept at home, and would
not go a message, but was always running after his
“beasts,” his father at last determined to take his
clothes from him altogether. So, one morning when
he went to work, he carried them with him. When
the boy got up, and found that he had nothing to
wear, he was in a state of great dismay. His
mother, having pinned a bit of an old petticoat round
his neck, said to him, “I am sure you’ll be a prisoner
this day.” But no! His mother went downstairs
for milk, leaving him in the house. He had tied a
string round his middle, to render himself a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
more fit for moving about. He followed his mother
downstairs, and hid himself at the back of the entry
door; and as soon as she had passed in, Tom bolted
out, ran down the street, and immediately was at his
old employment of hunting for crabs, horse-leeches,
puddocks, and sticklebacks.</p>

<p>His father, on coming home at night with Tom’s
clothes in his hand, looked round the room, and asked,
“Is he in bed?” “Na!” “Far<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is he?” “Weel,
I left him here when I gaed to the door for milk,
and when I came back he was awa; but whether he
gaed out o’ the window or up the lum<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I canna tell.”
“Did ye gie him ony claes?” “No!” “Most
extraordinary!” exclaimed the father, sitting down
in his chair. He was perfectly thunderstruck. His
supper was waiting for him, but he could not partake
of it. A neighbouring woman shortly after entered,
saying, “Meggy, he’s come!” “Oh, the nickem,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
said Tom’s mother, “surely he’s dead wi’ cauld by
this time. Fat <i>can</i> we do wi’ him? Oh, Mrs.
Kelman, he’ll break my very heart. Think o’ him
being oot for haill days without ony meat. Often
he’s oot afore he gets his breakfast, and we winna
see him again till night. Only think that he’s been
out a’ the day ’maist naked! We canna get him
keepit in frae thae beasts o’ his!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RECEPTION ON RETURN.</i></div>

<p>“He’ll soon get tired o’ that,” said Mrs. Kelman,
“if ye dinna lick him.” “Never,” roared old Edward;
“I’ll chain him in the house, and see if that will cool
him.” “But,” rejoined Mrs. Kelman, “ye maunna
touch him the night, John.” “I’ll chain him to the
grate! But where is he? Bring him here.” “He’s
at my fireside.” By this time Tom, having followed
at her heels, and heard most of what was said about
him, was ready to enter as she came out. “Far hae
ye been, you scamp?” asked his mother. “At the
Tide!” His father on looking up, and seeing the
boy with the old petticoat about him, bedabbled by
the mud in which he had been playing, burst into a
fit of laughter. He leant back on his chair, and
laughed till he could laugh no more.</p>

<p>“Oh, laddie,” said the mother, “ye needna look
at me in that way. It’s you that he’s laughin’ at,
you’re sic a comical sicht. Ye’ll gang to that stinkin’
place, man, till ye droun yoursel, and sine ye winna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
come back again.” Tom was then taken in hand,
cleaned and scrubbed, and put to bed. Next morning
his father, before he went out, appeared at the
boy’s bedside, and said, “If ye go out this day, sir,
I’ll have you chained.” “But,” replied Tom, “ye
hinna a cooch;”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for he had no notion of anything
being chained but dogs. “Never mind,” said his
father, “I’ll chain you!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IS LAID UP BY FEVER.</i></div>

<p>The boy had no inclination to rise that day. He
was hot and cold alternately. When he got up in
the afternoon, he was in a “gruize.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Then he went
to bed again. By the evening he was in a hot
fever. Next day he was worse. He raved, and became
delirious. He rambled about his beasts and his
birds. Then he ceased to speak. His mouth became
clammy and his tongue black. He hung between
life and death for several weeks. At length the fever
spent itself, leaving him utterly helpless.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as he was gradually getting better,
he observed his mother sitting by his bedside.
“Mother,” said he, “where are my crabs and bandies
that I brocht hame last nicht?” “Crabs and bandies!”
said she, “ye’re surely gaun gyte;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> it’s three months
sin ye were oot!” This passed the boy’s comprehension.
His next question was, “Has my father gotten
the chains yet?” “Na, laddie, nor winna; but ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
maunna gang back to yer auld places for beasts again.”
“But where’s a’ my things, mother?” “They’re
awa! The twa bottoms o’ broken bottles we found
in the entry, the day you fell ill, were both thrown
out.” “And the shrew mouse ye had in the boxie?”
“Calton (the cat) took it.” This set the boy a-crying,
and in that state he fell asleep, and did not
waken till late next morning,—when he felt considerably
better. He still, however, continued to make
inquiries after his beasts.</p>

<p>His father, being in-doors, and seeing the boy rising
and leaning upon his elbow, said to him, “Come
awa, laddie. It’s long since ye were oot. The whins,
and birds, and water-dogs<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at Daiddie Brown’s burnie,
will be a’ langin to see ye again.” The boy looked
at his mother, and smiled, but said nothing. In a
few days he was able to rise, but the spring was well
advanced before he was able to go out of doors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS RECOVERY.</i></div>

<p>He then improved rapidly. He was able to go
farther and farther every day. At first he wandered
along the beach. Then he roamed about over the
country. He got to know the best nesting places—the
woods, plantations, and hedges,—the streams,
burns, locks, and mill-dams,—all round Aberdeen.
When the other boys missed a nest, it was always
“that loon Edward” that took it. For this he was
thrashed, though he was only about four years old.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RUBISLAW QUARRIES.</i></div>

<p>One of his favourite spots was the Den<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and quarries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of Rubislaw. There were five excellent places in
the Den for birds’ nests and wild flowers. But he went
to the quarries chiefly to find the big bits of sheep’s
silver or mica in the face of the rocks. Edward was
much astonished at the size of the rocks. He knew
how birds made their nests; he knew how flowers
and whins grew out of the ground; but he did not
know how rocks grew. He asked his parents for the
reason. They told him that these rocks had existed
from the beginning. This did not satisfy him, and
he determined to ask one of the men at the quarry,
who certainly ought to know how the rocks grew.
“How do the rocks grow?” asked he of a quarryman
one day. “Fat say ye?” Tom repeated the question.
“To the deil wi’ ye, ye impudent brat, or I’ll toss ye
owre the head o’ the quarry!” Tom took to his heels
and fled, never looking back.</p>

<p>Another favourite haunt was Daiddie Brown’s
burnie. There were plantations and hedges near it,
and fields close at hand on either side. Its banks
were thickly clothed with wild raspberries and whins—the
habitats of numerous birds. The burn itself
had plenty of water-dogs, or water-rats, along its
banks. That neighbourhood has now been entirely
overbuilt. The trees, the hedges, the whins, and
even the burn itself, have all been swept away.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOVE OF BIRDNESTING.</i></div>

<p>Tom’s knowingness about birds’ nests attracted
many of his boy-fellows to accompany him in his
expeditions. He used to go wandering on, forgetful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of time, until it became very late. On such occasions,
the parents of the boys became very anxious
about them; and knowing that Tam Edward was the
cause of their being kept so long away from home,
they forbade them accompanying him again on any
account. When he asked them to go with him a-birdnesting,
their answer usually was, “Wha wad
gang wi’ you? ye never come hame!” Even when
Tom did get any boys to follow him, he usually returned
alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>“A BYKE” IN THE WOOD.</i></div>

<p>On one occasion he got some boys to accompany
him to a wood at Polmuir, about two miles from
town, on a birdnesting expedition. While they were
going through the wood, a little separated, one of
them called out, “A byke, a byke,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> stickin’ on a tree,
and made o’ paper!” A byke was regarded as a
glorious capture, not only for the sake of the honey,
but because of the fun the boys had in skelpin’ out
the bees. Before they had quite reached the spot,
one of the youngest boys yelled out, “Oh! I’m stung,
I’m stung!” He took to his feet, and they all followed.
After they had run some distance, and there
being no appearance of a foe, a halt was made, and
they stood still to consider the state of affairs.
But all that could be ascertained was, that the byke
was on a tree, that it was made of paper, and that it
had lots of yellow bees about it.</p>

<p>This so excited Tom’s curiosity that he at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
proposed to go back and take down the paper byke.
His proposal was met with a decided refusal; and on
his insisting upon going back, all the other boys ran
away home. Nothing daunted, however, he went
back to that part of the wood where the byke had
been seen. He found it, and was taking it from the
under side of the branch to which it was attached,
when a bee lit upon one of his fingers, and stung it
severely. The pain was greater than from any sting
that he had ever had before. He drew back, and
sucked and blew the wound alternately, in order to
relieve the pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SECURES THE BYKE.</i></div>

<p>Then he thought, “What can I do next?” There
the byke hung before him. It was still in his power
to remove it,—if he could. To leave it was impossible.
Although he had nothing to defend himself
from the attacks of the bees, nor anything to put the
byke into when he had taken it down, still he would
not go without it. His bonnet could scarcely do. It
was too little and too holey. His stockings would
not do; because he wished to take the byke home
whole. A thought struck him. There was his
shirt! That would do. So he took off his jacket,
and disrobed himself of his shirt. Approaching the
tree very gently, though getting numerous stings by
the way, he contrived to remove the byke from the
branch to which it was hanging, and tucked it into
his shirt. He tied the whole up into a sort of round
knot, so as to keep all in that was in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now getting quite dark, and he hurried
away with his prize. He got home in safety. He
crept up the stair, and peeped in at the keyhole, to
see that the coast was clear. But no! he saw his
father sitting in his chair. There was an old iron
pot in a recess on one side of the stair, in which Tom
used to keep his numerous “things,” and there he
deposited his prize until he could unpack it in the
morning. He now entered the house as if nothing
had happened. “Late as usual, Tam,” said his father.
No further notice was taken. Tom got his supper
shortly after, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Before getting into bed, he went a little out of
way to get undressed, and then, as much unseen as
possible, he crept down beneath the blankets. His
brother, having caught sight of his nudity, suddenly
called out, “Eh, mother, mother, look at Tam! he
hasna gotten on his sark!” Straightway his mother
appeared at the bedside, and found that the statement
was correct. Then the father made his appearance.
“Where’s your shirt, sir?” “I dinna ken.” “What!
dinna ken!” addressing his wife—“Where’s my
strap?” Tom knew the power of the strap, and
found that there was no hope of escaping it.</p>

<p>The strap was brought! “Now, sir, tell me this
instant, where is your shirt?” “It’s in the bole on
the stair.” “Go and get it, and bring it here
immediately.” Tom went and brought it, sorrowfully
enough, for he dreaded the issue. “And what have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
you got in it?” “A yellow bumbees’ byke.” “A
what?” exclaimed his father and mother in a
breath. “A yellow bumbees’ byke.” “Did I not
tell you, sir,” said his father, “only the other day, and
made you promise me, not to bring any more of these
things into the house, endangering and molesting us
as well as the whole of our neighbours. Besides only
think of your stripping yourself in a wood, to get off
your shirt to hold a bees’ byke!”</p>

<p>“But this is a new ane,” said Tom, “it’s made o’
paper.” “Made o’ fiddlesticks!” “Na, I’ll let ye see
it.” “Let it alone, I don’t want to see it. Go to bed
at once, sir, or I shall give you something (shaking
his strap) that will do you more good than bees’
bykes!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WASP’S NEST.</i></div>

<p>Before the old couple went to bed, they put Tom’s
shirt into a big bowl, poured a quantity of boiling
water over it, and after it was cold, they opened the
shirt, and found—a Wasps’ Nest!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small><i>SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> was between four and five years old when
he went to school. He was sent there principally
that he might be kept out of harm’s way. He did
not go willingly; for he was of a roving, wandering
disposition, and did not like to be shut up anywhere.
He hated going to school. He was confined there
about four hours a day. It might seem very little
to some, but it was too much for him. He wanted
to be free to roam about the Inches, up the Denburn,
and along the path to Rubislaw, bird-nesting.</p>

<p>The first school to which he was sent was a dame’s
school. It was kept by an old woman called Bell
Hill. It was for the most part a girls’ school, but
Bell consented to take the boy because she knew his
mother, and wished to oblige her. The schoolroom
was situated at the top of a long stair. In fact, it
was the garret of an ordinary dwelling-house.</p>

<p>We have said that Tom did not like school. He
could not be reconciled to spend his time there.
Thus he often played the truant. He was sometimes
arrested on his way to school by the fish-market. It
was then held in the Shiprow, where the post-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
now stands. There were long rows of benches on
which the fish were spread out. The benches were
covered in, and afforded an excellent shelter on a
rainy day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FISH-MARKET.</i></div>

<p>Tom was well known to the fishwives. “Here
comes the queer laddie,” they would say as they saw
him approaching. And when he came up, they
would ask him, “Weel, man, fat are ye gaun to speer<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
the day?” Tom’s inquiries were usually about fish—where
they came from, what their names were,
what was the difference between the different fishes,
and so on. The fish-market was also a grand place
for big blue flies, great beetles with red and yellow
backs (burying beetles), and daylight rottens. They
were the tamest rats he had ever seen, excepting two
that he used to carry about in his pockets. His rats
knew him as well as a dog knows his master.</p>

<p>But Tom’s playing the truant and lingering about
the fish-market soon became known to his mother;
and then she sent for <i>her</i> mother, Tom’s grannie, to
take him to school. She was either to see him “in
at the door,” or accompany him into the school
itself. But Tom did not like the supervision of his
grannie. He rebelled against it. He played the
truant under her very eyes. When grannie put him
in at the door, calling out “Bell!” to the schoolmistress
upstairs, Tom would wait until he thought
the old woman was sufficiently distant, and then steal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
out, and run away, by cross streets, to the Denburn
or the Inches.</p>

<p>But that kind of truant-playing also got to be
known; and then grannie had to drag him to school.
When she seized him by the “scruff o’ the neck,”
she had him quite tight. It was of no use attempting
to lie down or sit down. Her hand was like a vice,
and she kept him straight upon his feet. He tried
to wriggle, twist, turn himself round as on a pivot,
and then make a bolt. She nevertheless held on, and
dragged him to school, into the presence of Bell Hill,
and said, “Here’s your truant!” Tom’s only chance
was to go along very quietly, making no attempt to
escape grannie’s clutches, and then, watching for an
opportunity, he would make a sudden dart and slip
through her fingers. He ran, and she ran; but in
running, Tom far outstripped her, for though grannie’s
legs were very much longer than his, they were also
very much stiffer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ATTRACTIONS OF THE DENBURN.</i></div>

<p>The boy was sent one morning to buy three rolls
for breakfast; but after he had bought the rolls,
instead of going home, he forgathered with three
loons, and accompanied them to the Denburn. He
got a lot of horse-leeches, and was in the act of getting
another when, looking in the water, he saw the
reflection of grannie approaching. When he felt her
fingers touching his neck, he let go the stone under
which the horse-leech was, and made a sudden bound
to the other side of the burn. He heard a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
splash in the water. His comrades called out, “Tam,
Tam, yer grannie’s droonin’!” But Tam neither
stopped nor looked back. He flew as fast as he
could to the Inches, where he stopped to take breath.
The tide coming in, drove him away, and then he
took refuge on the logs, near the Middens; after
which he slunk home in the evening.</p>

<p>His mother received him thus: “Ye’re here again,
ye ne’er-do-well! creepin in like a thief. Ye’ve been
wi’ yer raggamuffins: yer weet duds tell that. That’s
wi’ yer Inches, an’ tearin an’ ridin on the logs, an’
yer whin bushes. But ye may think muckle black
shame o’ yersel, man, for gaun and droonin yer peer
auld grannie.” “I didna droon her,” said Tom.
“But she may hae been drooned for you; ye didna
stay to tak her oot.” “She fell in hersell.” “Haud
yer tongue, or I’ll take the poker t’ye. Think shame,
man, to send her hame in sic a filthy state. But
where’s the bread I sent ye for?” “It’s a’ eaten.”
“We wad hae had a late breakfast if we had waited
till now, and sine ye’ve no gottin it after a’. But
yell see what yer faither ’ill say to ye when he gets
hame.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TOM AND HIS GRANNIE.</i></div>

<p>Tom was in bed by that time. He remained
awake until his father returned in the evening. He
was told the whole story by his wife, in its most
dreadful details. When he heard of grannie’s plash
into the burn, and coming home covered with “glaur,”
he burst out into a long and hearty laugh. Tom heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it with joy. The father then remarked that grannie
should “beware of going so near the edge of such a
dirty place.” Then Tom felt himself reprieved, and
shortly after fell asleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL HILL AND THE BEASTS.</i></div>

<p>The scapegrace returned to school. He did not
learn a great deal. He had been taught by his
mother his A B C, and to read words of three letters.
He did not learn much more at Bell Hill’s school.
Bell’s qualifications as a teacher were not great.
Nevertheless, the education that she gave was a
religious education. She prayed, or as Edward called
it, “groaned” with the children twice a day. And it
was during one of her devotional exercises that the
circumstance occurred which compelled Bell Hill to
expel Tom Edward from her school.</p>

<p>Edward had been accustomed to bring many of
his “beasts” with him to school. The scholars were
delighted with his butterflies; but few of them cared
to be bitten or stung by his other animals. And to
have horse-leeches crawling about them was unendurable.
Thus Edward became a source of dread and
annoyance to the whole school. He was declared to
be a “perfect mischief.” When Bell Hill was informed
of the beasts he brought with him, she used
to say to the boy, “Now, do not bring any more of
these nasty and dangerous things here again.”
Perhaps he promised, but generally he forgot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE “KAE” AT SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>At last he brought with him an animal of a much
larger sort than usual. It was a Kae, or jackdaw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He used to keep it at home, but it made such a noise
that he was sent out with it one morning, with strict
injunctions not to bring it back again. He must let
it go, or give it to somebody else. But he was fond
of his kae, and his kae was fond of him. It would
follow him about like a dog. He could not part with
the kae. So he took it to school with him. But how
could he hide it? Little boys’ trousers were in those
days buttoned over their vest; and as Tom’s trousers
were pretty wide, he thought he could get the kae in
there. He got it safely into his breeks before he
entered the school.</p>

<p>So far so good. But when the schoolmistress gave
the word “Pray,” all the little boys and girls knelt
down, turning their backs to Bell. At this movement
the Kae became fractious. He could not accommodate
himself to the altered position. But seeing a
little light overhead, he made for it. He projected
his beak through the opening between the trousers
and the vest. He pushed his way upwards; Tom
squeezed him downwards to where he was before.
But this only made the Kae furious. He struggled,
forced his way upwards, got his bill through the
opening, and then his head.</p>

<p>The Kae immediately began to <i>cre-waw! cre-waw!</i>
“The Lord preserv’s a’! Fat’s this noo?” cried Bell,
starting to her feet. “It’s Tam Edward again!”
shouted the scholars, “wi’ a craw stickin’ oot o’ his
breeks!” Bell went up to him, pulled him up by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
collar, dragged him to the door, thrust him out, and
locked the door after him. Edward never saw Bell
Hill again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOES TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>The next school to which he was sent was at the
Denburn side, near by the venerable Bow brig, the
oldest bridge in Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but now swept away
to make room for modern improvements. This
school consisted wholly of boys. The master was
well stricken in years. He was one of the old school,
who had great faith in “the taws,”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as an instrument
of instruction. Edward would have learnt much
more at this school than at Bell Hill’s, had he not
been so near his favourite haunt, the Denburn. He
was making rapid progress with his reading, and was
going on well with his arithmetic, when his usual
misfortune occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HORSE-LEECHES AT SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>One day he had gone to school earlier than usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The door was not open; and to wile away his time
he went down to the Denburn. He found plenty of
horse-leeches, and a number of the grubs of water-flies.
He had put them into the bottom of a broken bottle,
when one of the scholars came running up, crying,
“Tam, Tam, the school’s in!” Knowing the penalty
of being behind time, Tom flew after the boy, without
thinking of the bottle he had in his hand. He contrived,
however, to get it into the school, and deposited
it in a corner beside him, without being observed.</p>

<p>All passed on smoothly for about half-an-hour,
when one of the scholars gave a loud scream, and
started from his seat. The master’s attention was
instantly attracted, and he came down from the desk,
taws in hand. “What’s this?” he cried. “It’s a
horse-leech crawlin’ up my leg!” “A horse-leech?”
“Yes, sir, and see,” pointing to the corner in which
Tom kept his treasure, “there’s a bottle fu’ o’ them!”
“Give me the bottle!” said the master; and, looking
at the culprit, he said, “You come this way, Master
Edward!” Edward followed him quaking. On
reaching the desk, he stopped, and holding out the
bottle, said, “That’s yours, is it not?” “Yes.” “Take
it then, that is the way out,” pointing to the door;
“go as fast as you can, and never come back; and
take that too,” bringing the taws down heavily upon
his back. Tom thought that his back was broken,
and that he would never get his breath again.</p>

<p>A few days after, Tom was preparing to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
out, after breakfast, when his mother asked him,
“Where are ye gaun the day, laddie?” “Till my
school,” said he. “To your school, are ye? where
is’t? at the Inches, or the Middens, or Daiddie
Brown’s burnie? where is’t?” “At the fit o’ the
Green.” “At the fit o’ the Green! But hoo lang is
it since ye was putten awa frae that school?” Tom
was silent. He saw that his mother had been informed
of his expulsion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXPELLED FROM SECOND SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>In a little while she was ready to go out. She
took hold of her son by the cuff of the neck, and took
him down to the Green. When she reached the
school, for the purpose of imploring the master to
take her son back, she knocked at the door, and the
master at once appeared. Before she could open her
mouth, the master abruptly began, “Don’t bring that
boy here! I’ll not take him back—not though you
were to give me twenty pounds! Neither I, nor my
scholars, have had a day’s peace since he came here.”
And with that he shut the door in her face, before she
could utter a single word. She turned and came away,
very much vexed. She kept her grip on the boy, but,
standing still to speak to a neighbour, and her hold
getting a little slacker, he made a sudden bolt, and
escaped.</p>

<p>As usual, he crept in late in the evening. His
father was at home, reading. On entering, Tom
observed that he stopped, fixing his eyes upon him
over the top of his book, and looked at him steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for some time. Then, laying down his book, he said,
“And where have you been, sir?” The boy said
nothing. “It’s no wonder that you’re dumb. You’ve
been putten out of your school a second time. You’ll
be a disgrace to all connected wi’ you. You’ll become
an idler, a ne’er-do-well. You’ll get into bad company.
You’ll become a thief! Then you’ll get into
gaol, and end your days in misery and shame. Such
is the case with all that neglect their schooling, and
disregard what their parents bid them.”</p>

<p>Tom was at last ashamed of himself. He said
nothing until supper-time; and then he asked for
his supper, as he was hungry. “Perhaps you are,”
said his father; “and you shall get no supper this
night, nor any other night, until you learn to behave
yourself better. Go to bed, sir, this moment!” Tom
slunk away, and got to bed as soon as possible.
When the lights were out, and all were thought to be
abed, a light hand removed the clothes from over
Tom’s head, and put something into his hand. He
found it to be “a big dad o’ bread and butter.” It
was so like the kind motherly heart and hand to
do this. So Tom had his supper after all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SENT TO HIS THIRD SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>He was next sent to the Lancaster School in
Harriet Street. There were two masters in this
school. The upper classes were in the highest storey,
the other classes in the lowest. The master of the
lower class, to which Tom belonged, knowing his
weakness, ordered him, on entering, not to bring any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of his beasts to that school. He was to pay more
attention to his lessons than he had yet done, or he
would be punished severely. He did not bring anything
but his school-books for a long time, but at last
his usual temptation befell him. It happened in this
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPARROW’S NEST.</i></div>

<p>On his way to and from school, along School Hill,
he observed a sparrow’s nest built in the corner part
of a spout. He greatly envied the sparrow’s nest.
But he could only feast his longing eyes at a distance.
He tried to climb the spout once or twice, but it was
too high, and bulged out at the top. The clamps
which held the spout to the wall were higher at the
top than at the bottom. He had almost given up the
adventure in despair, when one day, on going to
school, he observed two men standing together and
looking up in the direction of the nest. Boy-like,
and probably thinking that he was a party concerned
in the affair, he joined them, and listened to what
they were talking about. He found that the nest
interfered with the flow of water along the spout, and
that it must be removed; and that the whole waterway
along the spout must also be cleaned out.</p>

<p>Tom was now on the alert, and watched the spout
closely. That day passed, and nothing was done.
The next day passed, and still the men had not made
their appearance. But on the third day, on his way
to school, he observed a man and a boy placing a
long ladder against the house. Tom stopped, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
guessing what was about to be done, he intended to
ask the man for the nest and its contents. The man
was about to ascend the ladder, when, after feeling
his pockets and finding that something had been forgotten,
he sent the boy back to the shed for something
or other,—most probably a trowel. Then, having
struck a light, and set fire to his pipe, the man betook
himself to the churchyard, which was near at hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEST “HARRIED.”</i></div>

<p>A thought now struck Tom. Might he not take
the nest himself without waiting for it, and perhaps
without getting it after all? He looked about. He
looked into the churchyard gate, nearly opposite. He
saw nobody. The coast was clear. Tom darted across
the street, and went rapidly up the ladder. Somebody
shrieked to him from a window on the other
side. It staggered him at first. But he climbed
upward; got to the nest, and, after some wriggling
and twisting, he pulled it away, and got down before
either the man or the boy had returned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>YOUNG SPARROWS AT SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>It was eggs that he wanted, but, lo and behold!
here was a nest of five well-fledged birds. Instead
of taking the birds home, Tom was foolish enough to
take them with him to school. He contrived to get
the nest into the school unobserved, and put it below
the form on which he was seated, never thinking that
the little things would get hungry, or try to make
their escape. All went on well for about an hour.
Then there was a slight commotion. A chirrup was
heard. And presently the throats of all were opened—“<i>Chirrup!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
chirrup!</i>” Before the master could
get the words “What’s that?” out of his mouth, the
birds themselves answered him by leaving their nest
and fluttering round the schoolroom,—the boys running
after them! “Silence! Back to your seats!”
cried the master. There was now stillness in the
school, except the fluttering of the birds.</p>

<p>The culprit was called to the front. “This is
more of your work, Edward, is it not?” “Yes, sir.”
“And did I not tell you to bring no more of these
things here.” “Yes, sir; but I only got them on
my way up, or I wouldn’t have brought them here.”
“I don’t believe it,” said the master. “Yes, it’s true,
it’s true,” shouted some of the scholars. “Silence!
How do you know?” “We saw him harryin’ the
nest as we came up School Hill.” “How?” “He
was on the top of a long ladder takin’ the nest oot o’
a spoot.” “Well, sir,” he said to Edward, “you are
one of the most daring and determined little fellows
that I have ever heard of. It seems you will follow
nobody’s advice. If you do not give up your tricks,
you will some day fall and break your neck. But as
you have told me the truth, I will forgive you this
once. But remember! it’s the last time. Now go,
collect your birds, and take them away!”</p>

<p>Edward groped about to collect the birds, but few
of them were left. The windows having been let
down, they had all escaped except one. He got that
one, and descended to the street. There he recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
two other “gorbals.” He went home with his three
birds; but, his sister being ill, his mother told him
to take them away, because they made such a noise.
In the course of the day he gave them to another
boy, in exchange for a little picture-book, containing
“The Death and Burial of Cock Robin.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT LANCASTER SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>Next morning he went back to school, and from
that time forward he continued to obey the master’s
orders. He never brought any more “beasts” there.
He was at the Lancaster school about eighteen
months, though he was occasionally absent. He
did not learn very much. The Bible was used as
the reading book, and when he left school he could
read it fairly. He could also repeat the Shorter Catechism.
But he knew very little of arithmetic, and
nothing of grammar. He had only got the length of
the rule of two,—that is, he could add up two lines
of figures. He could not manage the multiplication
table. He could only multiply by means of his
fingers. He knew nothing of writing.</p>

<p>We must mention the cause of his leaving his
third and his last school. He had entirely given
up bringing “beasts” with him. But he had got a
bad name. It was well known that he had been
turned out of all the schools which he had formerly
attended, on account of bringing his “beasts” with
him. Better kill a dog, it is said, than give him a
bad name. In Edward’s case, his bad name was attended
with very serious results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A MAGGY MONNY FEET.</i></div>

<p>One morning, when the boys were at their lessons
and the master was at his desk, a sudden commotion
occurred. The master gave a loud scream, and,
jumping to his feet, he shook something from his
arm, and suddenly put his foot upon it. Then, turning
in Edward’s direction, he exclaimed, “This is
some more of your work, Master Edward.” Not
hearing what he said, Edward made no reply. Another
boy was called forward, and both stooping down, they
took up something and laid it on a sheet of paper.
On rising, the boy was asked what it was. “It’s a
Maggy Monny Feet,” he said. “Is its bite dangerous?
Is it poisonous?” The boy could not tell.</p>

<p>Edward was then called to the floor. “You’ve
been at your old trade, Edward, I see; but I’ll now
take it out of you. I have warned you not to bring
any of your infernal beasts here, and now I have just
found one creeping up my arm and biting me. Hold
up.” Edward here ventured to say that he had not
brought the beast, that he had not brought anything
for a long while past. “What! a lie too?” said the
master: “A lie added to the crime makes it doubly
criminal. Hold up, sir!” Tom held up his hand, and
the master came down upon it very heavily with the
taws. “The other!” The other hand was then held
up, and when Tom had got his two hot hands, the
master exclaimed, “That’s for the lie, and this for the
offence!” and then he proceeded to bring the taws
heavily down upon his back. The boy, however, did
not cry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD UNJUSTLY PUNISHED.</i></div>

<p>“Now, sir,” said the master, when almost out of
breath, “will you say now that you did not bring it?”
“I did not; indeed, sir, I did not!” “Well then, take
that,” giving him a number of tremendous lashes along
his back. “Well now?” “I did not!” The master
went on again: “It’s your own fault,” he said, “for
not confessing your crime.” “But I did not bring it,”
replied Edward. “I’ll flog you until you confess.”
And then he repeated his lashes, upon his hands, his
shoulders, and his back. Edward was a mere mite of
a boy, so that the taws reached down to his legs, and
smote him there. “Well now,” said the master, after
he was reduced to his last effort, “did you bring it?”
“No, sir, I did not!”</p>

<p>The master sat down exhausted. “Well,” said he,
“you are certainly a most provoking and incorrigible
devil.” The master had a reddish nose, and a number
of pimples on his face, which were of the same
hue. When he got into a rage, it was observed that
the protuberances became much brighter. On this
occasion his organ became ten times redder than
before. It was like Bardolph’s lanthorn in the poop.
Some of the boys likened his pimples to large driblets
of blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXPELLED FROM HIS THIRD SCHOOL.</i></div>

<p>After resting for a while in his chair, Edward
standing before him, he called to the boy whom he
had first brought to his assistance, “William, bring
forward that thing!” The boy brought forward
the paper, on which lay a bruised centipede. “Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
then,” said the master, “did you not bring that
venomous beast here?” “I did not, sir!” The whole
school was now appealed to. “Did any of you see
Edward with that beast, or any other beast, to-day or
yesterday?” No answer. “Did any of you see
Edward with anything last week or the week before?”
Still no answer. Then, after a considerable pause,
turning to Edward, he said, “Get your slate. Go home,
and tell your father to get you put on board a man-of-war,
as that is the best school for all irreclaimables
such as you.” So saying, he pointed to the door. Tom
got his slate and his books, and hurried down stairs.
And thus Edward was expelled from his third and
last school.</p>

<p>On reaching home, he told his parents the circumstances
connected with his expulsion. He also added
that he wouldn’t go to school any more; at all events,
he wouldn’t go back to “yon school.” He would rather
go to work. He was told that he was too young to
work; for he was scarcely six years old. His father
proposed to take him to the Lancaster school on the
following day, for the purpose of inducing the master
to take back the boy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NIGHT UNDER THE LOGS.</i></div>

<p>The next day arrived. His father came home from
his work for the purpose of taking the boy to school;
but Tom had disappeared. He would not go back.
He went first to the fish-market, where he spent the
greater part of the day. Then he went down to the
Inches. From thence he went towards the logs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
whilst there with a few more boys preparing sparrow-traps,
one of them called out “Tam, there’s yer
faither!” Tom immediately got up, and ran away;
his father, following him, called out “Stop, sir! stop,
sir! come back, come back, will you!” Tom’s father
was a long slender man, and could not stand much
running. He soon dropt behind, while Tom went out
Deeside way like a lamplighter. He never stopped
until he reached the Clayholes. Not seeing his
father following him, he loitered about there until
it was nearly dark; he then returned, keeping a close
look-out and ready to run off again. At length, about
dark, he got back to the logs.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that on the spare ground
above the Inches large piles of logs were laid, some
of them of great size. The logs were floated down
the Dee, and were laid there until the timber merchants
found it convenient to take them away. Little
care being exercised in putting up the piles, there
were often large openings left at the ends. Instead
of going home, the boy got into one of these openings,
and crept in as far as he could get. But though he
was in a measure out of sight, he soon found that he
could obtain very little shelter for the night. He was
barefooted, and his clothes were thin and raggy. The
wind blew through the logs, and he soon became very
cold. He shivered till his teeth chattered. The
squeaking and jumping of the rats, of whom there
seemed to be myriads, kept him awake. It was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
different from being snug in his warm bed, that he
once thought of getting out of his hole and running
home. But he was terrified to do that, and thus
encounter his father’s strap,—his back being still so
sore from the effects of his flogging at school. The
cold continued to increase, especially towards the
small hours of the morning. Indeed, he never experienced
so bitterly cold a night in the whole
course of his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FRUITLESS SEARCH.</i></div>

<p>At length morning began to dawn. The first streaks
of light were tinging the eastern sky, when Tom prepared
to get out of his hole and have a run in the
open ground to warm himself. He was creeping out
of the logs for the purpose, when in the dim morning
light he thought he saw the figure of a man. Yes!
it was his father. He saw him moving about, among
the sawpits, the logs, and the piles of wood. Tom
crept farther into his hole among the logs; and on
looking out again, he found his father had disappeared.
Half-an-hour later he appeared again; and
after going over the former ground, he proceeded in
the direction of the Inches. In a few minutes he descended
to the channel, doubtless with the intention
of crossing, as the tide was out at the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S RETURN HOME.</i></div>

<p>Now, thought Tom, is my opportunity. He crept
out of his hole, went round the farther end of the
logs, up Lower Dee Street, past the carpet-weaver’s,
up Carmelite Street, and then home. Just as he
reached the top of the stair, Mrs. Kelman, the kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“neibour,” who had been kept up all night by the
troubles of the Edward family, took him by the collar,
and said, “Eh, laddie, ye hae gien yer folk a sair
nicht o’t! But bide a wee, I’ll gang in wi’ ye!” As
she entered the door, she exclaimed, “Here he’s again,
Maggie, a’ safe!” “Oh, ye vagaboon,” said the
mother, “where hae ye been a’ nicht? Yer faither’s
oot seekin’ ye. I wonder how I can keep my hands
aff ye.” “No, no, Maggie,” said Mrs. Kelman, “ye
winna do that. But I’ll tell ye what ye’ll do. Gie
him some meat, and let him get to his bed as fast as
he can.” “His bed?” said his mother, “he shanna
bed here till his faither comes in.” “Just gie him
something, Maggie, and get him oot o’ the road.”
After some parleying, Tom got something to eat, and
was in bed, with the blankets over him, before his
father returned.</p>

<p>“Weel, John,” said Mrs. Kelman, “ye hinna gotten
him?” “No.” “Ye hinna gaun to the right place!”
“The right place!” said John, “who on earth could
tell the right place for such a wandering Jew as he
is?” “Weel, I’ve got him.” “Where?” “At the
head o’ the stair!” “And where is he now?” “Where
he should be.” “That’s in Bridewell!” “No, no,
John, dinna say that.” “Where, then?” “In his
bed.” “What! here? And before I have paid him
for his night’s work?” “Now, John, just sit doun
and hae a cup o’ tea wi’ Maggie and me before you
go to your wark; and if ye hae onything to say to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
laddie, ye can say it when he gets up.” “You always
take his part, Mrs. Kelman, always!”</p>

<p>Tom lay quaking in bed. He heard all that
was said. He peeped out of the blankets; but when
he saw his father sit down, he knew that all was safe.
And when he had his friendly cup o’ tea, and went to
his work, Tom fell fast asleep. He did not awake
until midday, when his father returned to dinner.
Being observed to move in his bed, his father ordered
him to get up. This set him a-crying, and he
exclaimed that “he wudna gang back to yon school.”
His mother now asked the reason why he was so
bitter against going to “yon school.” He then told
them how he had been treated by the master, and
how his back was sore yet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESULTS OF HIS PUNISHMENT.</i></div>

<p>His back was then looked at, and it was found
that his shirt was hard with clotted blood, and still
sticking to his skin. The wales extended right down
to his legs. Means were adopted to soften the
shirt and remove it from the skin. But while that
was being done, the boy fell back and fainted away.
On coming to himself, he found his mother bathing
his brow with cold water, and Mrs. Kelman holding
a smelling-bottle to his nose, which made his eyes run
with water. A large piece of linen, covered with
ointment, was then put upon his back. His father
went away, ordering him to keep the house, and not
to go out that day.</p>

<p>Whatever may have passed between his parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he did not know. He was in bed and asleep when
his father returned at night. But he was never
asked to return to the Lancaster school.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">

<div class="caption">AULTEN LINKS, ABERDEEN.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE AULTEN LINKS.</i></div>

<p>He had now plenty of time for excursions into
the country. He wandered up the Dee and along
the banks of the Don on both sides. He took
long walks along shore,—across the Aulten Links to
the Auld Brig,—and even up to the mountains, which
at Aberdeen approach pretty near to the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HUNT AFTER AN ADDER.</i></div>

<p>During one of his excursions on the hills of Torrie,
near the commencement of the Grampians, while
looking for blaeberries and crawberries, Edward saw
something like the flash of an eel gliding through
amongst the heather. He rushed after it, and pounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
down upon it with both hands, but the animal had
escaped. He began to tear up the heather, in order to
get at it. His face streamed with perspiration. He
rested for a time, and then began again. Still there
was no animal, nor a shadow of one.</p>

<p>At this time another boy came up, and asked,
“What are ye doing there?” “Naething.” “D’ye
call that naething?” pointing to about a cart-load of
heather torn up. “Have ye lost onything?” “No.”
“What are ye looking for then?” “For something
like an eel!” “An eel!” quoth the lad; “do ye think
ye’ll find an eel amang heather? It’s been an <i>adder</i>,
and it’s well ye havena gotten it. The beast might
have bitten ye to death.” “No fear o’ that,” said
Edward. “How long is it sin’ ye saw it?” “Some
minutes.” “If that’s the case, it may be some miles
up the hills by this time. Which way was it gaun?”
“That way.” “Well,” said the lad, “you see that
heap o’ stones up there? try them, and if you do not
find it there, you may gang hame and come back
again, and then ye’ll just be as near finding it as ye
are now.” “Will ye help me?” asked Edward. “Na
faith, I dinna want to be bitten to death.” And so
saying, he went away.</p>

<p>Edward then proceeded to the pile of stones which
had been pointed out, to make a search for the
animal. He took stone after stone off the heap, and
still there was no eel. There were plenty of worms
and insects, but these he did not want. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
beyond the stones lay a large piece of turf. He
turned it over, and there the creature was! He was
down upon it in an instant, and had it in his hand!
He looked at the beast. It was not an eel. It was very
like an asp, but it was six or seven times longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TAKES HOME THE ADDER.</i></div>

<p>Having tightened his grip of the beast, for it was
trying to wriggle out of his hand, he set out for home.
He struck the Dee a little below where the Chain
Bridge now stands, reaching the ford opposite Dee
village, and prepared to cross it. But the water being
rather deep at the time, he had to strip and wade
across, carrying his clothes in one hand and the “eel”
in the other. He had only one available hand, so that
getting off and on his clothes, and wading the river
breast high, occupied some time.</p>

<p>On reaching the top of Carmelite Street, he observed
his mother, Mrs. Kelman, and some other
women, standing together at the street door. He
rushed in amongst them with great glee, and holding up
his hand, exclaimed, “See, mother, sic a bonnie beastie
I’ve gotten.” On looking at the object he held in his
hand, the conclave of women speedily scattered.
They flew in all directions. Edward’s mother
screamed, “The Lord preserv’s! what the sorrow’s that
ye hae noo?” “Oh, Meggy, Meggy,” said Mrs.
Kelman, “it’s a snake! Dinna let him in! For
ony sake dinna let him in, or we’ll a’ be bitten.”
The entry door was then shut and bolted, and Tom
was left out with the beast in his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Kelman’s husband then made his appearance.
“What’s this, Tam, that has caused such a flutter
amongst the wives?” “Only this bit beastie.”
Kelman started back. “What, has it not bitten
you?” “No!” “Well,” he added, “the best thing
you can do with it, is to take it to Dr. Ferguson as
fast as you can, for you can’t be allowed to bring it
in here.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ferguson kept a druggist’s shop at the corner
of Correction Wynd, near the head of the Green.
He had a number of creatures suspended in glass jars
in his window. Boys looked in at these wonderful
things. They were the admiration of the neighbours.
Some said that these extraordinary things had come
from people’s “insides.” Tom had often been there
before with big grubs, piebald snails, dragonflies, and
yellow puddocks. So he went to Dr. Ferguson with
his last new prize.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ADDER SOLD.</i></div>

<p>He was by this time surrounded by a number of
boys like himself. They kept, however, at a respectable
distance. When he moved in their direction,
they made a general stampede. At length he arrived
at the Doctor’s door. When the Doctor saw the
wriggling thing that he was holding in his hand, he
ordered him out of the shop, and told him to wait in
the middle of the street until he had got a bottle
ready for the reception of the animal. Tom waited
until the bottle was ready, when he was told that
when he had gotten the snake in, he must cork the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bottle as firmly as possible. The adder was safely
got in and handed to the Doctor, who gave Tom
fourpence for the treasure. Next day it appeared
in the window, to the general admiration of the
inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TOM’S REWARD.</i></div>

<p>Tom hastened home with his fourpence. On
entering the house he encountered his father, who
seized him by the neck, and asked, “Where’s that
venomous beast that you had?” “I left it with Dr.
Ferguson.” “But have you no more?” “No.”
“That’s very strange! You seldom come home with
so few things about you. But we shall see.” The
boy was then taken into the back yard, where he was
ordered to strip. Every bit of clothing was shaken,
examined, and searched; the father standing by with
a stick. Nothing was found, and Tom was allowed
to put on his clothes and go up stairs to bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small><i>APPRENTICESHIP.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> boy was learning idle habits. He refused to go
back to the Lancaster school. Indeed, from the cruel
treatment he had received there, his parents did not
ask him to return. He had now been expelled
from three schools. If he went to a fourth, it is probable
that he might also have been expelled from
that. It would not do for him to go scouring the
hills in search of adders, or to bring them home to
the “terrification” of his neighbours. He himself
wished to go to work. His parents at last gave their
consent, though he was then only about six years old.
But poor people can always find something for their
children to do out of doors. The little that they
earn is always found very useful at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TOBACCO WORKING.</i></div>

<p>Edward’s brother, who was about two years older
than himself, was working at Craig and Johnston’s
tobacco work. On inquiry, it was found that the
firm was willing to take young Edward at the wage
of fourteen-pence a week. The tobacco-spinners
worked in an old house situated at the end of the
flour mill in St. Nicholas Street. Each spinner had
three boys under him—the wheeler, the pointer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the stripper. Edward went through all these grades. As
a stripper he could earn about eighteen-pence a week.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;"><a id="brig"></a>

<div class="caption">THE BRIG O’ BALGOWNIE.</div>
</div>

<p>The master was a bird-fancier, so that Edward
got on very well with him. The boy brought him
lots of nests and young birds in summer, and old
birds which he trapped during winter. The master
allowed him to keep rabbits in the back yard; so that,
what between working and playing, attending to his
rabbits and catering for their food, his time passed
much more happily than it had done at school.</p>

<p>After being in the tobacco work for about two
years, Edward heard that boys were getting great
wages at a factory at Grandholm, situated on the
river Don, about two miles from Aberdeen. The
high wages were a great attraction. Tom and his
brother took the advantage of a fast-day to go to the
mill and ask for employment. The manager told the
boys that he wanted no additional hands at that
time, but that he would put their names down and
let them know when he required their services.</p>

<p>They returned and told their parents what they
had done. Both father and mother were against the
change, partly because of Tom’s youth, and partly
because of the distance Grandholm was from Aberdeen.
Tom, however, insisted that he could both work and
walk; and at last his parents gave their consent.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 410px;">

<div class="caption">THE SPIRES OF ST. MACHAR.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BANKS OF THE DON.</i></div>

<p>There was another reason besides the high wages
which induced Tom to wish to be employed at Grandholm.
He kept this to himself. He had often seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the place before, though only at a distance. But who
that has seen the banks and braes of the Don, from
the Auld Brig<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to the Haughs of Grandholm, can
ever forget it? Looking down from the heights above
the Brig of Balgownie, you see the high broad arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thrown across the deep and dark winding Don. Beneath
you, the fishermen are observed hauling to the
shore their salmon nets. Westward of the Auld
Brig the river meanders amongst the bold bluff
banks, clothed to the summit with thick embowered
wood. Two or three miles above are the Haughs,
from which a fine view of the Don is obtained, with
the high wood-covered bank beyond it; and, over all,
the summits of the spires of St. Machar, the cathedral
church of Old Aberdeen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT GRANDHOLM MILLS.</i></div>

<p>It was to roam through these woods and amidst
this beautiful scenery, that young Edward so much
desired to be employed at the Grandholm factory. Nor
was he disappointed in his expectations. Scarcely
three days had elapsed ere a letter arrived at the
Edwards’ house, informing both the boys that they
would be employed at the mill at the usual wages.
The hours were to be from six o’clock in the morning
till eight o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>The boys had accordingly to be up by about four
in the morning, after which they had to get their
breakfast and to walk two miles to their work. They
were seldom home at night before nine. It was delightful
in summer, but dreary in winter, when they
went and came in the cold dark nights and mornings.
The wages of the boys were at first from three to four
shillings a week each, and before they left the mill
their wages were from five to six shillings a week.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FACTORY WORK.</i></div>

<p>The boys were first put into the heckling shop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
They were next transferred to a small mill at the end
of the larger one. Young Edward worked there.
His business was to attend at the back of a braker,—to
take away the cases when they were full, and
put empty ones in their places. He was next set
to attend two carding-machines; and from these to
the roving or spinning side, three of which he frequently
kept before he left. This was the highest
work done in that room.</p>

<p>“People may say of factories what they please,”
says Edward, “but I liked this factory. It was a
happy time for me whilst I remained there. It was
situated in the centre of a beautiful valley, almost
embowered amongst tall and luxuriant hedges of hawthorn,
with watercourses and shadowy trees between,
and large woods and plantations beyond. It teemed
with nature and natural objects. The woods were
easy of access during our meal-hours. What lots of
nests! What insects, wild flowers, and plants, the
like of which I had never seen before! Prominent
amongst the birds was the Sedge Warbler,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which
lay concealed in the reedy copses, or by the margin
of the mill-lades. Oh! how I wondered at the little
thing; how it contrived to imitate almost all the
other birds I had ever heard, and none to greater
perfection than the chirrup of my old and special
favourite the sparrow.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KINGFISHER.</i></div>

<p>One day he saw a Kingfisher—a great event in
his life! What a beautiful bird! What a sparkling
gem of nature! Resplendent in plumage and gorgeous
in colour—from the bright turquoise blue to the
deepest green, and the darker shades of copper and
gold. Edward was on a nesting excursion, with
some little fellows like himself, along the braes of the
Don, and at some distance above the Auld Brig,
when he first saw this lustrous bird. “I was greatly
taken,” he says, “with its extraordinary beauty, and
much excited by seeing it dive into the stream. I
thought it would drown itself, and that its feathers
would eventually become so clogged with water that
it would not be able to fly. Had this happened—which,
of course, it did not—my intention was to
have plunged in to the rescue, when, as a matter of
course, I would have claimed the prize as my reward.
Thus buoyed up, I wandered up and down
the river after the bird, until the shades of even
came down and forced me to give up the pursuit;
and I then discovered, having continued the chase
so long, that I was companionless, and had to return
home alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COUNTRY RAMBLES.</i></div>

<p>“It so happened, that for a month or two during
summer-time, owing to the scarcity of water, one
part of the factory worked during the night-time and
the other during the day-time, week and week about.
This was a glorious time for me. I rejoiced particularly
in the night work. We got out at six in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
morning, and, instead of going directly home, I used
to go up to the woods of Scotston and Scotston Moor,
scoured the country round them, and then returned
home by the Auld Brig. Another day I would go
up to Buxburn, range the woods and places about
them, and then home by Hilton or Woodside. Or
again, after having crossed Grandholm Bridge, instead
of going up by Lausie Hillock, I went away
down Don side, by Tillydrone, the Aulten (Old Aberdeen),
through the fields to the Aulten links, whipped
the whins there, then over the Broad hill, and home
by Constitution Street. I would reach it, perhaps,
about dinner-time, instead of at seven in the morning,
although I had to be back at the mill again by
eight o’clock at night.</p>

<p>“Once, on a Saturday, after having visited Buxburn,
I went round by the back of the Dancing
Cairns to the Stocket and the woods of Hazelhead,
then down the Rubislaw road, and home in the evening.
Ah! these were happy days. There were no
taws to fear, and no tyrannical dominie to lay them
on. True, the farm people did halloo at me at
times, but I generally showed them a clean pair of
heels. The gamekeepers, also, sometimes gave me
chase, but I managed to outstrip them; and although
no nests were to be got, there was always
something to be found or seen. In winter-time, also,
when the canal was frozen, a mile of it lay in our
way home, and it was capital fun to slide along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
going to and coming from our work. This was life,
genuine life, for the young. But, alas! a sad change
was about to come; and it came very soon.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>APPRENTICED TO A SHOEMAKER.</i></div>

<p>The boys remained at Grandholm factory for about
two years. Their father thought that they ought
both to be apprenticed to some settled trade. The
eldest boy left first, and was apprenticed to a baker;
then Tom, the youngest, left, very much to his regret,
and was bound apprentice to a shoemaker. He was
eleven years old at that time. His apprenticeship
was to last for six years. His wages began at eighteenpence
a week, with sixpence to be added weekly in
each succeeding year. He was to be provided by his
master with shoes and aprons. The hours were to be
from six in the morning to nine at night,—two hours
being allowed for meals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES BEGG.</i></div>

<p>The name of Edward’s master was Charles Begg.
His shop was situated at the highest part of Gallowgate.
He usually employed from two to three workmen.
His trade consisted chiefly in manufacturing
work of the lightest description, such as ladies’ and
children’s boots and shoes. He himself worked principally
at pump-making, and that was the branch of
the trade which young Edward was taught.</p>

<p>Begg was a low-class Cockney. He was born in
London, where he learnt the trade of shoemaking.
He had gradually wandered northwards, until he
reached Inverness, where he lived for some time.
Then he went eastward to Elgin, then to Banff, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
at last he arrived at Aberdeen, where he married and
settled. Begg was a good workman; though, apart
from shoemaking, he knew next to nothing. It is well,
however, to be a good workman, if one does his work
thoroughly and faithfully. The only things that Begg
could do, besides shoemaking, were drinking and
fighting. He was
a great friend
of pugilism;
though his principal
difficulty,
when he got
drunk, was to
find anybody to
fight with in
that pacific
neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/image069.jpg" width="287" height="336" alt="store front with pass-through" />
<div class="caption">CHARLES BEGG’S SHOP, GALLOWGATE.</div>
</div>

<p>It was a great
misfortune for
the boy to have
been placed under
the charge
of so dissolute a vagabond. He had, however, to do his
best. He learnt to make pumps and cut uppers, and
proceeded to make shoe-bottoms. He would, doubtless,
have learnt his trade very well, but for the
drunkenness of his master, who was evidently going
headlong to ruin. He was very often absent from
the shop, and when customers called, Edward was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sent out by his mistress to search the public-houses
frequented by Begg; but when found, he was usually
intoxicated. The customers would not return, and
the business consequently fell off. When drunk,
Begg raved and swore; and after beating the boy in
the shop, he would go up-stairs and beat his wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHOEMAKERS’ PETS.</i></div>

<p>Shoemakers are usually very fond of pets, and
especially of pet birds. Many of the craft have
singing-birds about them, and some are known to be
highly-skilled and excellent bird-fanciers. But Begg
had no notion of pets of any kind. He had no love
whatever for the works of nature, and detested those
who had. Edward had been born with the love of
birds and living creatures, and Begg hated him accordingly.
Begg used to rifle his pockets on entering
the shop, to see that Edward had nothing of the kind
about him. If he found anything he threw it into
the street,—his little boxes with butterflies, eggs,
and such like. Many a blow did he give Edward on
such occasions. He used to say that he would
“stamp the fool out of him;” but he tried in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEGG’S BRUTALITY.</i></div>

<p>One afternoon, when Edward had finished his work,
and was waiting for the return of his master in order to
go to dinner, he was sitting with a sparrow on his knee.
It was a young sparrow which he had trained and
taught to do a number of little tricks. It was his pet,
and he loved it dearly. While he was putting the
sparrow through its movements, the master entered.
He was three parts drunk. On looking at the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on Edward’s knee, he advanced, and struck Edward
such a blow that it laid him flat on the floor. The bird
had fluttered to the ground, and was trampled on.</p>

<p>When Edward was about to rise, he saw that Begg
was going to kick him. Raising up his arm to ward
off the blow, Begg’s foot came in contact with it,
and, losing his balance, he reeled, staggered against
the wall, and fell backwards. He gathered himself
together and got up. If angry before, he was furious
now. Edward, seeing that he was again about to resume
his brutality, called out that he would shout for help,
and that he wouldn’t be struck again without a cause!
“Without a cause, you idle blackguard! sitting playing
with some of your devils instead of doing my
work!” “I had no work; it was done three hours
ago, and I was waiting to go to my dinner.” “It’s
not near dinner time yet.” “It’s four o’clock!” “I
didn’t know it was so late; well, you may go!”</p>

<p>Tom seized the opportunity of picking up his poor
and innocent bird from the floor. He found it was
still breathing. He put it tenderly in his bosom
and hastened homewards. His mother was not
surprised at his lateness, which was very usual, in
consequence of the irregularity of his master’s hours.
“But what’s the matter wi’ ye?” she said; “your face
is bleedin’, and ye hae been greetin’.” “Look,” said he,
taking the harmless and now lifeless bird from his
breast, and holding it up,—“that would gar onybody
greet;” and his tears fell on the mangled body of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
little pet. “I wouldn’t have cared so much for myself,”
he said, “if he had only spared my bird!”
Then he told his mother all that had happened, and he
added that if Begg struck him again without a cause, he
would certainly run away. She strongly remonstrated
against this; because, being bound apprentice for six
years, he must serve out his time, come what would.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S PETS KILLED.</i></div>

<p>On returning to the shoemaker’s shop in the
afternoon, Edward was met at the door by his
master, who first shook him and then searched him.
But finding there was nothing about him, he was
allowed to go to his seat. And thus three years
passed. The boy learnt something of his trade. The
man went on from bad to worse. In his drunken
fits he often abused and thrashed his apprentice.
At last the climax came. One day Edward brought
three young moles to the shop. The moles were safely
ensconced in his bonnet. When Begg found the moles
he killed them at once, knocked down Edward with a
last, seized him by the neck and breast, dragged him
to the door, and with a horrible imprecation threw
him into the street. Edward was a good deal hurt;
but he went home, determined that from that day he
would never again serve under such a brute.</p>

<p>Begg called at his mother’s next day, and ordered
the boy to return to his work. Edward refused. Begg
then invoked the terrors of the law. “He would
compel Edward to fulfil his apprenticeship. He
would prosecute his father and his two sureties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
make them pay the penalty for breaking the boy’s
indenture.” This threat gave Edward’s mother a
terrible fright, especially when her boy insisted that
he would not go back. The family were left in fear
and commotion for some time. But at last, as nothing
further was heard of the threatened prosecution, they
dismissed it from their minds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WISHES TO BE A SAILOR.</i></div>

<p>What was Edward to do next? He was thoroughly
sick of his trade, and wished to engage in some
other occupation that would leave him freer to move
about. He would be a sailor! He had a great
longing to see foreign countries, and he thought that
the best way of accomplishing this object was to
become a sailor. On mentioning the matter to
his parents, he was met with a determined and decided
refusal. They tried to dissuade him by various
methods. “Man,” said his father to him, “do you
know that sailors have only a thin plank between
them and death? Na, na! If you’re no gaun back to
Begg, you must find some other master, and serve out
your time. Bide ye at the shoemaker trade, and if
ye can make siller at it, ye can then gang and see as
mony countries as ye like!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OFFERS HIMSELF AS CABIN BOY.</i></div>

<p>Such was his father’s advice, but it did not suit
young Edward’s views. He wanted to be a sailor. He
went down to the harbour, and visited every ship there,
in order to offer himself as a cabin boy. He asked
the captains to employ him, but in vain. At last he
found one captain willing to take him, provided he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had the consent of his father. But this he could not
obtain, and therefore he gave up the idea for a time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/image073.jpg" width="404" height="319" alt="landscape with water in foreground and mill in background" />
<div class="caption">GRANDHOLM MILLS</div>
</div>

<p>Then he thought of running away from home.
He could not get away by sea; he would now try
what he could do by land. He had often heard his
parents talking about the Kettle, and of his uncle
who had gone in search of him to the gipsy camp.
Edward thought he would like to see this uncle. He
might perhaps be able to help him to get some other
and better employment than that of shoemaking. His
thoughts were very undefined about the matter. But
he certainly would not go back to work again with
Charlie Begg, the drunken shoemaker.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small><i>RUNS AWAY FROM HOME.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last Edward determined to run away from home,
and from Charlie Begg’s cruelty, and to visit his
wonderful uncle at the Kettle. The village is situated
nearly in the centre of the county of Fife,—about
a hundred miles from Aberdeen. Edward did
not know a step of the road; but he would try and
do his best to reach the far-off place.</p>

<p>The first thing that he wanted was money. All
his earnings had gone into the family purse, and
were used for family expenses. One day, when his
mother had gone out, leaving Edward to rock the
cradle, he went to look at the money box, and found
only a solitary sixpence in it. He wanted sevenpence
in all,—that is, a penny to get across Montrose
bridge, and sixpence to cross the Tay at Dundee.
He took the sixpence from the box, and fancied
that he might be able to raise another penny by
selling his knife. He took two quarters of oat-cakes,
put some oatmeal into a parcel, and bundling his
things together, and giving the cradle a final and
heavy rock, he left the house, and got away unseen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOURNEY TO THE KETTLE.</i></div>

<p>He ran up Deeside until he came to a high bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
near where the Allanvale cemetery now stands. He
went in amongst the bushes, took off his working
duds and put his Sunday clothes on; then, tying the
former in a bundle, he dug a hole amongst the sand
and shingle, and thrust them in, stamping upon them
to press them down. He covered up the whole with
grass, leaves, and shingle. Putting his stockings and
shoes together, and swinging them over his shoulder, he
set out barefoot for Kettle. He thought he might be
able to accomplish the journey in about two days.</p>

<p>Away he sped. Time was precious. The way
was long, and his provender was small. He had only
sixpence. He soon tried to raise the other penny.
He met with two herd boys and a girl. He said to
the boys, “Will ye buy a knife? I’ll give it you
cheap.” “No.” He passed through Stonehaven,
about sixteen miles from Aberdeen, and up a steep
brae on to Bervie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DUNNOTTAR CASTLE.</i></div>

<p>Edward was not much influenced by the scenery
through which he passed. He was anxious to
push on without loss of time. But one thing he
could not help seeing, and that was the ruins of
Dunnottar Castle. They lay on his left hand, on a
lofty rock-bound cliff, betwixt him and the sea.
They seemed to be of great extent, but he could not
turn aside to visit the ruins. They reminded him,
however, of the numerous stories he had heard about
them at home,—of the Covenanters who had been
thrust into the Whigs’ Vault at Dunnottar, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
many of them died,—of others who had tried to escape,
and been battered to pieces against the rocks, while
attempting to descend to the seashore,—and of the
Regalia of Scotland, which had been concealed there
during the wars of the Commonwealth. Thoughts
of these things helped him on his way; but the constant
thought that recurred to him was, how he could
sell his knife and raise the other penny.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/image075.jpg" width="390" height="247" alt="landscape" />
<div class="caption">RUINS OF DUNNOTTAR CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>As he was approaching Bervie, he met some lads
on the road, and asked them “Will you buy a knife?”
“Where did you steal it?” said the lads. Off went
Edward, followed by a volley of stones. He walked
on for a long time, until he got hot and tired. By
that time he had walked about twenty-five miles.
Then he sat down by the side of a spring to eat his
oatmeal, and swallow it down with water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>After resting himself for a time, he started up and
set off at full speed for Montrose. On his way he
saw numerous things that he would have liked to
take with him, and numerous woods that he would
have gone into and searched with right good will;
but the thought of the journey before him put all
other things aside. Kettle was still a long way off;
and besides, he still wanted the additional pontage
penny, in order to cross Montrose Bridge. He went
on and overtook a girl. He asked her if she would
buy a knife. “No!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENCOUNTER WITH TRAMPS.</i></div>

<p>He next overtook a man and woman with a lot
of bairns. They looked rather suspicious. He tried
to avoid them, and walked faster, but the man
addressed him: “Stop a minute, laddie; ye’re in
an awfy hurry!” “Yes,” said Edward, “I am in a
hurry.” “But have ye ony baccy?” “No, I have
no baccy.” “Try if he has ony clink,” said the
woman. “Have ye ony brass?” “No.” “Take
him, ye sheep,” said the woman to her husband, “and
squeeze him.” Tom, on hearing this, immediately
betook himself to his heels, and being a good runner,
soon left them far behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONTROSE.</i></div>

<p>At length he reached Montrose. Seeing some boys
gazing in at a shop window, he went up to them and
asked if they would buy a knife. “No!” Edward
thought he would never get rid of his knife. He
must raise a penny to get over Montrose bridge,
and yet he had nothing but his knife to sell. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
could not break into his sixpence. Then he bethought
him of offering the knife to the bridge-keeper,
and if he refused to buy it, he would try and run
the blockade. He went up to the bridge, looked at
the entrance, and felt that he could not run across
with success. He went away from the bridge, and
determined again to sell his knife. Walking up the
river, he came to some men working at a large building.
He asked if any of them wanted a knife. After a
little bargaining, one of the men said he would give a
penny for it. Edward was delighted. He rushed back
to the bridge, gave the bridge-keeper the penny, and
crossed in double quick time on his way to Arbroath.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SLEEPS IN A HAYCOCK.</i></div>

<p>It was now getting dark. He had walked all day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and was now very tired. He was desirous of putting
up somewhere for the night. But first he must have
his supper. He sat down by a little rill, and, with
the help of the water, ate some more of his meal
and a piece of his oat-cake. After he had refreshed
himself, he thought he could walk a few more miles.
He had now walked forty miles. The twilight being
long in the north, and the month being July, he went
on until he came to what he thought would be a
good beild<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for the night. This was a field in which
there were a number of haycocks. He crossed the
wall, went up to a haycock, pulled a lot of hay out,
then ensconced himself inside, and soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Towards morning he was wakened up by something
scratching at his brow. On putting his hand
up he found it was a big black beetle trying to
work its way in between his skin and his bonnet.
He wished he had had his box with him to preserve
the beetle, but he could only throw it away. As he
lay awake he heard the mice squeaking about him.
It was still dark, though there was a glimmering of
light in the east. Day was about to break. So he
got out of his hole, shook the hay from him, crossed
the wall, and resumed his journey.</p>

<p>Though he felt stiff at first, he soon recovered his
walking powers, and reached Arbroath by daylight.
Everybody was in bed, excepting one woman, whom
he saw standing at the end of a close-mouth. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
went up to her and asked, “which was the road to
Dundee.” When she began to speak, he saw that she
was either drunk, or daft, or something worse. He
went away, walked through several other streets, but
found no one astir. The town was asleep. Then he
sat down on a doorstep and ate some of his cake.
He was just beginning to fall asleep, when some men
who passed woke him up. They told him the road
to Dundee, and he instantly set off in that direction.</p>

<p>As he went on his way, he came up to a man
who was tramping along like himself. He belonged
to Dundee, was a weaver by trade, and had been
travelling through the country in search of work.
The man asked Edward where he had come from,
whither he was going, where he had slept, and what
money he had to carry him to the end of his journey.
On hearing that he had only enough to carry him
across the ferry at Dundee, the weaver gave him a
penny, saying that he would have given him more,
but that the penny was all the change he had.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SAILORS’ WIVES.</i></div>

<p>Shortly after, they overtook two women, who
turned out to be two sailors’ wives. They had come
from Aberdeen. The ship in which their husbands
sailed, had been chartered to Dundee, and would not
enter the port of Aberdeen for some time; hence the
journey of the wives to Dundee. The weaver, on
hearing where they came from, pointed to his little
companion, and said, “Here’s a laddie that comes
frae the same place, and as his wallet’s no very weel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
filled, perhaps ye might gie him a copper or two.”
One of the women looked hard at Edward, and said,
“I’ve surely seen ye before, laddie. Did ye ever
frequent the fishmarket i’ the Shipraw?” “Yes.”
“And ye had sometimes tame rottens wi’ ye?”
“Yes.” “Ah! I thocht sae. I used to help my
mother wi’ her fish, and was sure that I had seen ye
i’ the market.”</p>

<p>They then asked him where he was going? “Till
the Kettle,” he said. “Till the—what did ye say,
laddie?” “The Kettle!” How they laughed! They
had never heard of such a place before. But when
their laughter had settled down, they gave the boy
twopence; and as they parted, one of the women
said, “Tak’ care o’ yer feet, laddie, when ye step intil
the Kettle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DUNDEE.</i></div>

<p>On reaching Dundee, Edward crossed the Firth of
Tay by the ferry-boat, and reached Newport, in the
county of Fife. From thence he walked on to Cupar.
He was very much bewildered by the manner in which
the people told him the direction of the roads. They
told him to go south or north, or east or west. He
had no idea of these geographical descriptions. One
man told him to “gang east a bit, then turn south,
syne haud wast.”</p>

<p>He went in the direction indicated, but he could
proceed no farther. He sat down on a stone at the
side of the road, and fell fast asleep. A gentleman
passing in a gig, called out to him, “Boy! boy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
get up! don’t lie sleeping in the sun there; it’s very
dangerous!” On wakening up he was much dazed, and
he did not at first remember where he was. When
he finally got up, he asked the gentleman the road to
Cupar. On being properly directed, he set off again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.</i></div>

<p>The road along which he passed lay for some time
through a wood. Among the various birds which he
saw and heard, he observed a group of little round
birds not much bigger than a hazel nut, with very long
tails. They squeaked like mice, and hung to and went
round about the slenderest twigs. He had never seen
such little birds before. He did not know their
names, but he afterwards found that they were the
Long-tailed Titmouse. The little things were the
young brood of the parent bird, which was, no doubt,
hanging or flying somewhere near them.</p>

<p>Edward went into the wood to see them and follow
them. As he passed along he was called to from
behind, and a man came up and seized him by the
collar. The man, doubtless a keeper, roughly asked
him where he was going. “Naewhere!” “What
are you doing here then?” “Naething!” “What’s
that in your bundle?” “My stockings and shoes.”
“Let me see.” His bundle was then overhauled,
and nothing being found in it but his stockings and
shoes, he was allowed to depart, with the injunction
“never to return there again unless he wished to be
sent to jail.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARRIVES AT THE KETTLE.</i></div>

<p>After walking a few miles he reached Cupar, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
passing through it, went on towards Kettle. Coming
to a small burn he washed and dried his feet, and put
on his stockings and shoes, rubbing the dust from off
his clothes preparatory to arriving at his destination.
He reached Kettle in the evening, and soon found his
uncle. But the reception he met with did not at all
meet his expectations. It was anything but cordial.
After some inquiries, the uncle came to the conclusion
that the boy had done some mischief, and had run
away from his parents to hide himself in the Kettle.
He could not believe that the boy had come so far
merely to see him. The old man’s relations were all
dead, or had removed from the place. He was merely
lodging with a friend. The house in which he lodged
was full, and there was no spare bed for Edward. At
length the woman of the house said that she would
make up a bed for him in the place where she kept
her firewood.</p>

<p>When the boy had got his supper he was asked if
he could read. “A little.” The Bible was got, and
he was asked to read two chapters. He was next
asked if he could sing. “No.” He was then told
that he might go to bed. The bed was soft and sweet
to the tired boy. As he went to sleep he heard the
people of the house reading the Bible and singing a
psalm.</p>

<p>He slept very sound, and would have slept much
longer, but for his being wakened up next morning
for breakfast. The rain fell very heavily that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The boy began to feel very weary and lonesome, and
wished again to be at home. He had taken no
thought until now, of the results of his leaving so
suddenly. He thought of what his father and mother
might think of his disappearance. He wondered
whether he might now get away to sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RETURNS HOME.</i></div>

<p>But how was he to get home? He had now only
a poor halfpenny left. However, he had still a gully;
perhaps he might be able to sell that. After considering
the matter, he resolved to set out for Aberdeen,
rather than be a burden to the people at the Kettle.
He told his uncle that he would leave next day. The
uncle said nothing. The boy was up early next
morning, got his breakfast, and also a big piece of
bread, which he put in his bundle. His uncle accompanied
him a little way along the road, and at
parting gave him eighteenpence. Edward was overjoyed.
He would now be able to get home with
money in his pocket.</p>

<p>As he approached Newport he came up to three
men standing on the road. Two of them were gentlemen,
and the third seemed to be a gamekeeper. He
was showing them something which he had shot in
the adjoining wood. Edward went forward, and saw
that it was a bird with blue wings and a large variegated
head. “What do you want?” said the gamekeeper
to Edward. “To have a sight of the bird, if
you please.” “There, then,” said the gamekeeper, and
swung the bird in his face, nearly blinding him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
When the water was out of his eyes, and he could
see, he found that they had gone along the road.
He followed them, still expecting to see the bird, and
to have it in his hand; but the gamekeeper was
relentless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ADVENTURE WITH A BULL.</i></div>

<p>At length he reached the pier, just as the ferry-boat
was reaching the landing-place. He had another
pleasant voyage across the ferry to Dundee. His
object now was to push on to the field where he had
slept amongst the hay. He arrived at the place, but
there were no haycocks. The field was cleared. He
found some whins in the neighbourhood, and went
in amongst them and slept there until the sun was
well up the sky. He started up, and went rejoicing
on his way. He passed through Arbroath, and
was speeding on briskly to Montrose, when he came
up to a man standing in the middle of the road,
holding a bull by a rope. He asked the boy if he
would hold the bull for a few minutes until he went
to a house, which he pointed to, near at hand. “I
will give you something if you do,” said the man.
“Yes, I will,” said Edward, “if you’ll not be long.”
“No,” said the man, “I’ll not be long.”</p>

<p>On getting hold of the rope Edward found that
he was likely to have a difficult job. Scarcely had the
man disappeared ere the bull began to snort, and kick,
and jump. The brute threw up its head and bounded
backward with such force, that the boy was nearly upset.
Instead of holding the rope short as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
been told, he let it go, though he still held by it at the
far end. Away went the bull along the road, dragging
the boy after him. So long as the full stretch of rope
lay between them, Edward did not care so much; but
when the animal rushed into a field of corn, he let
go altogether, and resumed his journey.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he found, on looking
back, that he was hotly pursued by the animal. Observing
his danger, Edward rushed into a clump of
trees standing by the roadside, and, throwing down
his bundle, he proceeded to climb one of them. He
had only ascended a few yards when the brute came
up. The bull snorted and smelt at his bundle, threw
it into the ditch with his horns, bellowed at the boy
up the tree, gave a tremendous roar, then dashed out
of the wood, and set off at full speed down the nearest
byway. Edward was flurried and out of breath; he
rested in the tree for a short time, then descended
and ran along the road for some miles until he thought
that he was out of reach of further danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESTS NEAR STONEHAVEN.</i></div>

<p>This was the only adventure that he met with on his
homeward journey. He passed through Bervie without
molestation. But, instead of reaching Aberdeen
that night, as he had intended, he rested near Stonehaven.
He went through the town, and got into a
corner of the toll-bar dyke, where he sat or lay
until daybreak. He then got up and commenced the
last stage of his journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARRIVES AT ABERDEEN.</i></div>

<p>On reaching the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
went to the hole in the bank by Deeside, where he had
left his week-day clothes, and found them all right.
But before going home, instead of going down Deeside,
he turned up by Scraphards to look at a laverock’s
nest, which was still there. Then he went past Ferryhill
House, by Dee village, and struck the water-side
by the path now known as Affleck Street, and got
home at breakfast time, after an absence of a week.</p>

<p>His mother was in. “Where ha’e ye been now,
ye vagaboon?” “At my uncle’s.” “Where?”
“At the Kettle.” “And ha’e ye been a’ the way to
Fife, ye vagrant?” Tom then told his story; his
mother following it up with a long and serious
lecture. She reproached him for the dishonesty
which he had committed, in taking the sixpence out
of the box when he went away. “Weel, mother,”
said he, “here’s the sixpence for the one I took.”
He had saved the sixpence out of the eighteenpence
his uncle had given him when he left Kettle. “No,”
she replied, “the crime is the same after all, and you
are sure to be punished for it yet.”</p>

<p>Then she urged him to go back to his trade, for
he was far better at work than stravaigin<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> about the
country like an evil-doer. Edward asked if his father
would not consent now to his going to sea. She did
not think he would; she thought that to go back
to his work was the best thing of all. She herself
would not hear a word more about his going to sea.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small><i>RESUMES WORK.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of going directly back to his work, Edward
went down to the harbour to ascertain whether any
of the captains would accept of his services as a sailor.
He went from ship to ship for three days. Some
captains were willing to take him with an indenture,
which would have to be signed by his father.
Others were willing to take him without his father’s
consent; but in that case they required two sureties
to sign the indenture. These were serious obstacles—too
serious to be got over,—and on the third
afternoon he left the harbour with a sorrowful heart.
There were several skippers of coasting vessels,
and of lime and coal hulks, who would have taken
him for four years; but these were not the kind of
ships that he wished to sail in.</p>

<p>Being thus forced, though very reluctantly, to give
up all thoughts of going to sea, he now considered
whether it might not be possible to learn some other
trade less hateful to him than that of a shoemaker.
But his parents would not hear of any change. They
told him that his former master was willing to take
him back, and to give him a shilling a week more during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the ensuing year, and two shillings more during
his last, or fifth year. But Edward strongly objected
to return to the master who had so cruelly used him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESUMES SHOEMAKING.</i></div>

<p>Not wishing, however, to withstand his parents’
advice any longer, he at last consented to go on with
his trade. But, instead of serving out his time with
his former master, he found a pupil-master in Shoe
Lane, who was willing to employ him, and to improve
him in his business. Edward agreed to give the
master, for his trouble, a percentage of his earnings,
besides his pupil-money, and a share of the fire and
light.</p>

<p>Edward’s work at this place was mostly of the
lighter and smaller sort. His employer was of a much
kindlier nature than the last, and he got on very well
with him. Edward was also in a measure his own
master. He could still look after his bird-nesting.
That was his strongest attraction out of doors. He
did not rob the birds of their eggs. His principal
pleasure was to search for their nests, and to visit them
from time to time. When the eggs were hatched,
and the little birds were grown and ready to fly, he
would take one or two, if they were singing birds, and
rear them for himself, or for other bird-fanciers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WILD BOTANICAL GARDEN.</i></div>

<p>It was about this time that Edward began what
he called his Wild Botanical Garden. His parents
had left the Green and removed to another quarter
of the town. Behind the house, and behind the adjoining
houses, was a piece of waste ground about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ten feet wide. It was covered with stones, bits of
bricks, and broken tiles. Edward removed these from
the ground, and put them in a corner by themselves,
covering them with earth. He dug over the ground,
manured it, and turned it over again. Then he
divided the space into compartments for the reception
of plants and flowers. These were brought
from the fields, the woods, and the banks adjoining
the Dee and the Don. He watered and tended them
daily; but alas! they would not flourish as they had
done on their native soil. He renewed them again
and again. The rasp, the wild strawberry, the foxglove,—or
dead men’s bells as it is there called,—the
hemlock, some of the ferns, and many of the grasses,
grew pretty well; but the prettiest and most delicate
field flowers died away one by one.</p>

<p>His mother, who delighted in flowers, advised him
to turn the ground into an ordinary garden. Now,
although Edward loved garden flowers, he very much
preferred those which he found in the woods or growing
by the wayside, and which he had known from
his infancy. Nevertheless, he took his mother’s
advice; and knowing many of the places near the
town, where the gardeners threw out their rubbish,
he went and gathered from thence a number of roots,
flowers, and plants, which he brought home and
planted in his garden. The greater number of them
grew very well, and in course of time he had a
pleasant little garden. He never planted more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one specimen of each flower, so that his garden was
various in its beauty. The neighbours, who had at
first sneered at him as a fool, on seeing his pretty
garden, began to whisper that the “loon” was surely
a genius, and that it was a pity that his father had
not made him a gardener instead of a shoemaker.
Edward himself often wished that his parents had been
of the same mind as the neighbours.</p>

<p>Near the back of the house in which Edward lived,
was an old tannery, with a number of disused tanning
pits, full of water. These, he thought, would be a
nice place for storing his powets and puddocks.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He
got a large pail, went to a place where these creatures
abounded, and brought back a large cargo, heaving
them into the pit. But they did not thrive. They
nearly all died. He next put about thirty newts
there, but he never saw them again, dead or alive.
At last he gave up this undertaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PICTURE SHOPS.</i></div>

<p>About the same time, he used to make a tour
among the booksellers of the town, to inspect the
pictures which they had in their windows. These
visits proved a source of great profit and pleasure
to him. He learned something from the pictures, and
especially from the pictures of animals. He found
that there was more to be gained from a visit to the
picture shops than from a visit to the public-house.
When he saw a book that he could buy, he bought it,
though his means were still very small.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/image088.jpg" width="395" height="306" alt="town with large crowd of people in the square" />
<div class="caption">CASTLEGATE ON FRIDAYS.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CASTLEGATE.</i></div>

<p>It was in this way that he became acquainted with
the <i>Penny Magazine</i>. He bought the first number,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and liked it so well that he continued to take it.
He especially liked those parts of it which related to
natural history. Among the other publications which
he bought, was one called the <i>Weekly Visitor</i>. It
cost only a halfpenny. It had good pictures, and
gave excellent stories, which were usually of a religious
tendency. He read this little publication over
and over again. Nor did he ever lose the opportunity
of going to the Castlegate on Fridays, to see the pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and picture books, which were usually exposed
for sale on market days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GUNMAKERS’ WINDOWS.</i></div>

<p>The gunmakers’ windows were also a source of
attraction, for they often had stuffed birds exhibited
in them. There was also a window devoted entirely to
stuffed birds near the entrance to the police office in
Watch Lane, and another in Meal Market Lane, both
of which attracted a large share of his attention. The
sight of these things first gave Edward the idea of
preserving animals. The first beast he stuffed was a
mole, and he was very proud of it.</p>

<p>The shoemaking trade having become very flat, Edward
left Shoe Lane after having been there for about
twenty months. He then went to work at a shop on
the Lime Quay, near the harbour. He had steady work
there for some time, at set wages. Though he had
less time to attend to his natural history pursuits, he
still managed to attend to his garden and his “family,”
as his mother termed his maingie<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of beasts. Trade
again recovering, he went back to work at the old
place. But this did not continue long. The men
had to be paid off; and then Edward did not know
what to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRIES TO EMIGRATE.</i></div>

<p>At that time, emigration to America was the rage.
Trade was very depressed throughout the country.
There were bread riots in many of the manufacturing
towns. Numbers of labourers were without work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and without the means of living. Aberdeen shared
in the general depression; and many persons emigrated
to the United States, where there was a better
demand for labour. Edward wished to emigrate too;
but he had no money. He had only a few shillings
to spare. But might he not contrive to emigrate as
a Stowaway?</p>

<p>This course is frequently adopted at the ports from
which ships sail for America. A boy gets on board,
conceals himself in the hold, and after the ship has
got out of sight of land he makes his appearance on
deck, usually half-starved. Edward determined to try
this method of escaping from Aberdeen, and more
especially from his shoemaking trade. He knew
one of the sailors on board the ship which he had
selected; and although the sailor was strongly opposed
to the project, Edward prevailed upon him to make
an opening in the cargo, so as to admit him into a hole
near the bow of the ship. Here, amidst some boxes
and coils of rope, Edward deposited three dozen biscuits
and two bottles of water.</p>

<p>He waited outside, hovering about the quay, until
the day of sailing arrived. But the ship did not sail
until five days after the advertised time. When the
emigrants went on board, Edward went with them.
For three days and nights he lay amongst the coils of
rope, feeding upon his biscuits and water. On the
forenoon of the fifth day he was in his berth; and
just as the vessel was about to be loosed from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
moorings, Edward’s friend came along the hold in
breathless haste, and inquired (for he was in the dark)
“if he was there.” “Surely,” replied Edward. “For
the love of God,” said the sailor, “come out at once,
and get on shore. You have time yet. Simon Grant
(the town’s officer) and a lot of his sharks have come,
and they are about to rummage the ship from stem to
stern for runaways. So make haste, and come out;
you have no chance now!”</p>

<p>Edward still delayed. He did not like to leave
his hole. But hearing an unusual commotion going
on, amidst a great deal of angry speaking, and fearing
the worst, he at last very unwillingly crept from his
berth, went on deck, and leapt on shore just as the
ship was leaving the quay. He afterwards learnt
that the town’s officer was in search of another class
of stowaways, who, it seems, had been carried on
board in boxes or barrels. Edward found that he
could not see the world after this method; and he
returned home defeated and mortified.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ABERDEENSHIRE MILITIA.</i></div>

<p>The Aberdeenshire Militia having been called out
in 1831, Edward enlisted in the regiment. He was
only about eighteen years old at the time. When the
men assembled, they were found to be a very bad lot—mere
riff-raff—the dregs of the neighbourhood.
They were regardless both of law and order. Seldom a
night passed without the patrol bringing in numbers
to the guardhouse for being drunk and disorderly.
Even during parade, many of the men were put under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
arrest for insubordination, chiefly because of the insulting
language they used towards their officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLIES AFTER A BUTTERFLY.</i></div>

<p>The militia were only embodied for four weeks.
During the first fortnight, the regiment was drilled
without arms of any sort. It was only during the
last fortnight that the men were provided with muskets
and bayonets. The company to which Edward
belonged was drilling one day on the links. It was
a bright sunny afternoon. The company was marching
along near the lower part of the links, when
a large brown butterfly flitted past. Edward saw
it in an instant. He had never seen the like of that
butterfly before!<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Without thinking for a moment of
what he was doing, he flew after it,—among the bents
and sand hillocks, grasping after it with his hand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IS APPREHENDED.</i></div>

<p>The butterfly eluded him; it flew away before
him. Again he rushed after it, losing his bonnet
in the hunt. He was nearing the spot where it had
alighted. He would catch it now,—when suddenly
he was gripped by the neck! He looked round, and
saw it was the corporal of his company, with four
militiamen behind him.</p>

<p>Looking Edward sternly in the face, the corporal
said, “What’s up, Edward?” “Nothing.” “The
deuce!” “No, it wasn’t that, it was a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
butterfly.” “A butter-devil!” “No! it was a
butter-<i>fly</i>!” “Stuff!” said the corporal; “are you
mad?” “No; I don’t think I am.” “You look like
a madman; and I’ll tell you what it is, you’ll have
to pay for this.” “For what?” “For breaking
away from the ranks during drill. I am sent to
arrest you and take you to the guardhouse: so come
along!” And away they marched; two militiamen
before, two behind, and Edward and the corporal in
the centre. By this time a number of persons had
collected, the younger people calling out to their companions
to come and see the mad militiaman.</p>

<p>On crossing the links, the prisoner and his escort
encountered one of the officers of the regiment, accompanied
by a group of ladies. “Where are you going
with that boy?” said the officer, addressing the corporal.
“To the guardhouse!” “What? more insubordination?”
“Yes!” “This is most dreadful;
what has he done?” “He broke the ranks during
drill, and although Sergeant Forbes called him back,
he ran away after what he calls a butterfly!” There
was a short silence, after which the ladies were observed
tittering and laughing. “What did you say,
corporal?” “He ran out of the ranks after a butterfly.”
“What? ran away from his exercise for the
sake of an insect! Most extraordinary. Is he mad,
corporal?” “Well, the sergeant thinks so; and
that’s the reason why I have got four men to
help me to take him; but I don’t think that he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
mad.” “He must be drunk then?” “No, I don’t
think he’s drunk either.” “He must be either mad
or drunk: did he ever behave so before?” “No, not
to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>The officer and the ladies retired, and talked
together. After about five minutes had elapsed, the
officer returned and said to the corporal, “Are you
quite sure that the prisoner behaved himself properly
before his ridiculous chase after the butterfly?” “I
know of nothing whatever against him, sir.” “Call
him forward.” Edward advanced towards the officer.
“Well, sir, what have you to say about breaking the
ranks during drill, and running after the butterfly?
are you subject to fits of insanity?” Edward did not
reply. “Can’t you speak, sir?” cried the officer angrily.
“Yes, sir,” replied Edward, “but you have asked questions
that I cannot answer.” “What induced you to
leave the ranks, and run after a harmless insect?”
“I really do not know, unless it was from a desire to
possess the butterfly.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS LIBERATION.</i></div>

<p>Looks were exchanged between the officer and
corporal, when the former, calling Edward aside, said
to him, “I dare say, young man, you are not aware
that the crime which you have committed against
military discipline is a very severe one. This
constant disobedience to orders must be put a stop
to. But as this is your first offence, and as these
ladies have interceded for you, I shall endeavour to
obtain your acquittal, in the hope that you will closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
attend to your duty in future.” Addressing the
corporal, he added, “Take him back to the ranks, and
tell Sergeant Forbes that I will speak to him about
this affair.” This was Edward’s first and last military
offence; and he served out the rest of his time
with attention and diligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENLISTS IN THE RIFLES.</i></div>

<p>Edward disliked returning to his trade. His
aversion to it was greater even than before. He disliked
the wages, which were low; but he still more
disliked the manner in which the masters treated their
men. They sometimes kept them idle for days,
and towards the end of the week, they would force
them to work night and day in order to finish their
jobs. Edward liked his militia life much better;
and, in order to get rid of the shoemaking and continue
his soldier’s life, he enlisted in the 60th Rifles.
When his mother heard of the decision he had come
to, she expressed herself as strongly opposed to it;
and, working upon the young man’s feelings, which
were none of the hardest, he at last promised not to
go, and arrangements were made to get him off. Thus
ended Edward’s military career.</p>

<p>Before he left Aberdeen, he assisted his father as
beadle (or pew-opener) in the North Church, King
Street. He continued in this office for about two
years. He liked the occupation very well, and was
sorry to leave it when he finally left Aberdeen to
settle at Banff.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small><i>SETTLES AT BANFF.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> was about twenty years old when he left
Aberdeen, and went to Banff to work at his trade.
He found a master there willing to employ him.
Shoemaking had not improved. Men worked long
hours for little wages. The hardest worker could only
earn a scanty livelihood. Though paid by the piece,
the journeymen worked in the employers’ shops.
Their hours were from six in the morning till nine
at night. They had scarcely an interval of time that
they could call their own.</p>

<p>Edward found the confinement more miserable
than the wages. And yet he contrived to find
some time to follow his bent. He went after birds,
and insects, and butterflies. He annoyed his shopmates
almost as much as he had annoyed his schoolfellows.
In summer time, he collected a number of
caterpillars, and put them in a box beside him in the
workshop, for the purpose of watching them, and
observing their development into the chrysalis state.</p>

<p>In spite of his care, some of the caterpillars got
out, and wandered about the floor, sometimes creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
up the men’s legs. Some of the workmen did not
care, but one of them was almost thrown into convulsions
when he knew that a “worm was out.” The
other men played tricks upon him. When any of
them wanted a scene, they merely said, “Geordie,
there’s a lad oot!” Then Geordie would jump to
his feet, and would not sit down again until he was
assured that all the worms were fast in their boxes.</p>

<p>Edward was forced to keep his caterpillars in the
workshop, as the landlady with whom he lodged
would not allow any of his “vermin,” as she called
them, to enter her house. He had one day taken
in about a dozen caterpillars of the Puss Moth, and
asked her for a box to hold them in. The landlady
told him at once to get out of the house with his
“beasts.” She never could understand her lodger.
She could not fathom “fat kin’ o’ a chiel he was.
A’body tried to keep awa frae vermin but himsel’!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MARRIES A HUNTLY LASS.</i></div>

<p>The idea again recurred to Edward of saving
money enough to enable him to emigrate to the
United States. But this was prevented by his falling
in love! Man proposes: God disposes. He met
with a Huntly lass at the farm of Boyndie. He
liked her, loved her, courted her, married her, and
brought her home to the house which he had provided
for her in Banff.</p>

<p>Edward was only twenty-three years old when he
brought his wife home. Many may think that he
was very imprudent in marrying so early. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
knew nothing about Malthus on Population. He
merely followed his natural instincts. What kept
him, would keep another also. It turned out, however,
that he married wisely. His marriage settled
him for life. He no longer thought of emigrating
to America. Then his marriage gave him a happy
home. His wife was bright and cheerful, and was
always ready to welcome him from his wanderings.
They were very poor, it is true; but mutual affection
makes up for much. Perhaps they occasionally
felt the bitterness of poverty; for Edward’s earnings
did not yet amount to more than about 9s. 6d. a week.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STUDIES NATURAL HISTORY.</i></div>

<p>Another result of Edward’s marriage was, that it
enabled him to carry on his self-education in Natural
History. While he lived in lodgings, he had few
opportunities for collecting objects. It is true, he
explored the country in the neighbourhood of Banff.
He wandered along the sands towards Whitehills,
and explored the rocky cliffs between Macduff and
Gamrie. He learnt the geography of the inland
country and of the sea-coast. He knew the habitats
of various birds and animals. Some of the former he
procured and stuffed; for by this time he had acquired
the art of preserving birds as well as insects. But
while he lived in lodgings he had no room for stuffed
birds or preserved moths and butterflies. It was only
when he got a home of his own that he began to
make a collection of these objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WANT OF EDUCATION.</i></div>

<p>It was a great disadvantage to him that his education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
should have been so much neglected in his
boyhood. He had, it is true, been at three schools
before he was six years old, but, as we have already
seen, he was turned away from them all because of
his love of “beasts.” He had learned comparatively
little from his schoolmasters,—who knew little themselves,
and perhaps taught less. He was able to
read, though with difficulty. Arithmetic was to him
a thing unknown. He had not even learnt to write.
It was scarcely possible that he could have learned
much in his boyhood, for he went to work when he
was only six years old.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to teach him writing, whilst
he was apprenticed to Begg, the drunken shoemaker.
He asked leave to attend a writing school held in the
evening. His master could not, or would not, understand
the meaning of his request. “What!” said he,
“learn to write! I suppose you will be asking to
learn dancing next! What business have you with
writing? Am I to be robbed of my time to enable
you to learn to write?” Edward’s parents supported
the application, and at last the master gave his consent.
But there was always some work to do, or
something to finish and carry home to the master’s
customers, so that Edward rarely attended the writing
school; and at the end of the quarter, he knew
very little more of penmanship than he did at the
beginning.</p>

<p>Edward had to begin at the beginning with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
everything. As we have already said, he knew next
to nothing of books. He did not possess a single
work on Natural History. He did not know the
names of the birds and animals that he caught. For
many years after he had begun his researches, his
knowledge of natural objects was obtained by chance.
He knew little of the nature and habits of the creatures
that he went to seek; he scarcely knew where
or how to find them. Yet his very absence of knowledge
proved a source of inexhaustible pleasure to him.
All that he learnt of the form, habits, and characteristics
of birds and animals, was obtained by his
own personal observation. His knowledge had been
gathered and accumulated by himself. It was his
own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHY AND FRIENDLESS.</i></div>

<p>It was a misfortune to Edward that, after he had
attained manhood, he was so shy and friendless. He
was as solitary as Wordsworth’s Wanderer. He had
no friend of any sort to direct him in his studies;
none even to lend him books, from which he might
have obtained some assistance. He associated very
little with his fellow-workers. Shoemakers were
a very drunken lot. Edward, on the contrary,
was sober and thoughtful. His fellow shoemakers
could not understand him. They thought him an
odd, wandering, unsettled creature. Why should he
not, as they did, enjoy himself at the public house?
Instead of doing this, Edward plodded homewards so
soon as his day’s work was over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A LOVER OF NATURE.</i></div>

<p>There was, however, one advantage which Edward
possessed, and it compensated him for many difficulties.
He was an intense lover of Nature. Everything
that lived and breathed had charms for him.
He loved the fields, the woods, the moors. The
living presence of the earth was always about him,
and he eagerly drank in its spirit. The bubbling
brooks, the whispering trees, the aspects of the clouds,
the driving wind, were all sources of delight. He
felt himself free amidst the liberty of Nature.</p>

<p>The ocean in its devious humours,—sometimes
peacefully slumbering, or laving the sands with
murmuring kisses at his feet; then, full of life and
motion, carrying in and out the fishermen’s boats
along the shores of the Firth; or, roaring with seeming
agony, dashing itself in spray against the rockbound
coast,—these sights and scenes were always a
source of wonderment. As his wanderings were almost
invariably conducted at night, he had abundant opportunities
of seeing, not only the ocean, but the heavens,
in their various aspects. What were these stars so far
off in the sky? Were they worlds? Were they but
the outposts of the earth, from which other worlds
were to be seen, far beyond the ken of the most
powerful telescope?</p>

<p>To use Edward’s own words, “I can never succeed
in describing my unbounded admiration of the works
of the Almighty; not only the wonderful works
which we ourselves see upon earth, but those wondrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and countless millions of orbs which roll, both
near and far, in the endless immensity of space—the
Home of Eternity.</p>

<p>“Every living thing that moves or lives, everything
that grows, everything created or formed by the
hand or the will of the Omnipotent, has such a fascinating
charm for me, and sends such a thrill of pleasure
through my whole frame, that to describe my
feelings is utterly impossible.”</p>

<p>Another advantage which Edward possessed, besides
his intense love of Nature, was his invincible
determination. Whatever object in Natural History
he desired to possess, if it were possible to obtain it,
he never rested until he had succeeded. He sometimes
lost for a time the object of which he was in search,
because he wished to observe its traits and habits.
For this purpose, he would observe long and carefully,
before obtaining possession of it. By this means he
was enabled to secure an amount of information in
Natural History, such as no book, except the book of
Nature, could have supplied him with.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MAKES A COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>Edward proceeded to make a collection of natural
objects early in the spring of 1838. He was then
twenty-four years old, and had been married about a
year. He had, a short time before, bought an old gun
for four and sixpence; but it was so rickety that he
had to tie the barrel to the stock with a piece of
thick twine. He carried his powder in a horn, and
measured out his charges with the bowl of a tobacco-pipe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
His shot was contained in a brown paper bag.
A few insect bottles of middling size, some boxes
for containing moths and butterflies, and a botanical
book for putting his plants in, constituted his equipment.</p>

<p>As he did not cease shoemaking until nine at night,
nearly all his researches were made after that hour.
He had to be back to his work in the morning at six.
His wages were so small, that he could not venture to
abridge his working hours. It was indispensably
necessary for him to husband carefully both his time
and his money, so as to make the most of the one and
the best of the other. And in order the better to
accomplish this, he resolved never to spend a moment
idly, nor a penny uselessly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS EQUIPMENT.</i></div>

<p>On returning home from his work at night, his
usual course was to equip himself with his insect
boxes and bottles, his botanical book and his gun;
and to set out with his supper in his hand or
stowed away in his pocket. The nearest spring furnished
him with sufficient drink. So long as it was
light, he scoured the country, looking for moths, or
beetles, or plants, or birds, or any living thing that
came in his way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS WORK AT NIGHT.</i></div>

<p>When it became so dark that he could no longer
observe, he dropped down by the side of a bank,
or a bush, or a tree, whichever came handiest, and
there he dozed or slept until the light returned.
Then he got up, and again began his observations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which he continued until the time arrived when he
had to return to his daily labour. It was no unusual
circumstance for him—when he had wandered too
far, and come upon some more than usually attractive
spot—to strip himself of his gear, gun and all, which
he would hide in some hole; and thus lightened
of everything, except his specimens, take to his
heels and run at the top of his speed, in order to
be at his work at the proper time.</p>

<p>On Saturdays he could only make his observations
late at night. He must be home by twelve
o’clock. Sabbath-breaking is an intolerable sin in
Scotland, and Edward was never a Sabbath-breaker.
It was a good thing for his mental and physical health
that there was a seventh day during which he could
not and would not work. But for his seventh day’s
rest, he would have worked night and day. On
Sundays he went to church with his wife and family.
After evening service he took off his best clothes and
donned his working dress. Then he took a few hours’
sleep in his chair or lying across his bed, before setting
out. He thus contrived to secure a few hours’
observation on Monday mornings before six o’clock.</p>

<p>His neighbours used to say of him, “It is a
stormy night that keeps that man Edward in the
house.” In fact, his neighbours were completely bewildered
about his doings. They gave vent to all
sorts of surmises about his wanderings by night.
Exaggerated rumours spread about amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
town’s people. He went with a gun! Surely he
couldn’t be a poacher or a burglar? That was impossible.
It was well known that he lived soberly and
honestly, denying himself many things, and never
repining at his lot, though living a life of hardship.
But what could he mean by wandering about at
night amongst wild, lonely, and ghost-haunted places?
They wouldn’t have slept in Boyndie churchyard for
worlds! And yet that was one of Edward’s favourite
spots!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS AMBUSCADES.</i></div>

<p>He went out in fine starlit nights, in moonlight
nights, and in cold and drizzling nights. Weather
never daunted him. When it rained, he would look
out for a hole in a bank, and thrust himself into it,
feet foremost. He kept his head and his gun out,
watching and waiting for any casualties that might
happen. He knew of two such holes, both in sandbanks
and both in woods, which he occasionally frequented.
They were foxes’ or badgers’ dens. If any
of these gentry were inside when he took up his position,
they did not venture to disturb him. If they
were out they did the same, except on one occasion,
when a badger endeavoured to dislodge him,
showing his teeth. He was obliged to shoot it. He
could often have shot deers and hares, which came
close up to where he was; but they were forbidden
animals, and he resisted the temptation. He shot
owls and polecats from his ambuscades. Numbers of
moths came dancing about him, and many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he secured and boxed,—sending them to their long
sleep with a little drop of chloroform. When it
rained heavily, he drew in his head and his gun, and
slept until the first streaks of light appeared on the
horizon; and then he came out of his hole and proceeded
with his operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISAGREEABLE VISITORS.</i></div>

<p>At other times he would take up his quarters for
the night in some disused buildings—in a barn, a
ruined castle, or a churchyard. He usually obtained
better shelter in such places than if he were seated
by the side of a stone, a bush, or a wall. His principal
objection to them was, that he had a greater number
of visitors there than elsewhere,—such as polecats,
weasels, bats, rats, and mice, not to speak of hosts
of night-wandering insects, such as molluscs, beetles,
slaters, and centipedes. Think of having a polecat
or a weasel sniff-sniffing at your face while asleep!
Or two or three big rats tug-tugging at your pockets,
and attempting to steal away your larder. These
visitors, however, did not always prove an annoyance.
On the contrary, they sometimes proved a
windfall; for, when they came within reach, they
were suddenly seized, examined, and, if found necessary,
killed, stuffed, and added to the collection.</p>

<p>The coldest places in which Edward slept at night,
were among the rocks by the seaside, on the shingle,
or on the sea-braes along the coast. When exposed to
the east wind, these sleeping-places were perishingly
cold. When he went inland he could obtain better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
shelter. In summer time, especially, he would lie
down on the grass and sleep soundly, with the lock
of his gun for his pillow, and the canopy of heaven
for his blanket. His ear was always open for the
sounds of Nature, and when the lark was carolling
his early hymn of praise, long before the sun had
risen, Edward would rise and watch for daybreak—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 5em;">When from the naked top</span></div>
<div class="verse">Of some bold headland he beheld the sun</div>
<div class="verse">Rise up, and bathe the world in light.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the course of his wanderings inland, he was frequently
overtaken by storms in the hills. He carried
no cloak, nor plaid, nor umbrella, so that he often
got completely soaked before he could find shelter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHURCHYARD OF BOYNDIE.</i></div>

<p>One of the most remarkable nights Edward ever
spent, was under a gravestone in the churchyard of
Boyndie. The church of this parish was at one time
situated in the midst of the churchyard; but as it was
found inconvenient, and at a considerable distance
from the bulk of the parishioners, it was removed
inland, leaving but a gable end of the old church
standing. The churchyard, however, is still used
as a burying-place. It stands on a high piece of
ground overlooking the sea, about two miles west of
Banff. In clear days, the bold, rugged, precipitous
coast is to be seen, extending eastward as far as Crovie
Head. But the night of which we speak was very
dark; the sky was overhung with rolling clouds;
the sea was moaning along the shore. Edward expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a wild night, as he had seen the storm brewing
before he left home. Nevertheless he went out
as usual.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A TERRIBLE NIGHT.</i></div>

<p>He had always regarded a thunderstorm as one
of the grandest sights. He rejoiced in the warring
of the elements by day, and also by night when the
inhabitants of the earth were wrapped in sleep. As
he approached old Boyndie, the storm burst. The
clouds were ripped open, and the zigzag lightning
threw a sudden flood of light over land and sea.
Torrents of rain followed, in the midst of which
Edward ran into the churchyard and took shelter
under a flat tombstone supported by four low pillars.
There was just room enough for him to lie down at
full length. The storm was not yet at its height.
The thunder pealed and crashed and rolled along the
heavens, as if the universe were about to be torn
asunder, and the mighty fragments hurled out into
infinity. It became louder and louder—nearer and
nearer. The lightning flashed in red and yellowish
fiery streams; each flash leaving behind it a suffocating
sulphurous odour. Then followed torrents of
rain and hail and lumps of ice.</p>

<p>After the thunderstorm, the wind began,—lightly
at first, but, increasing rapidly, it soon blew a hurricane.
The sea rose, and lashed its waves furiously
along the coast. Although Edward had entertained
no fear of the thunder, he now began to fear lest
the tremendous fury of the wind would blow down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the rickety gable end of the old church of Boyndie;
in which case it would have fallen upon the tombstone,
under which he lay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/image103.jpg" width="369" height="610" alt="graveyard in the dark" />
<div class="caption">BOYNDIE CHURCHYARD.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A MYSTERY SOLVED.</i></div>

<p>The hurricane lasted for about an hour, after which
the wind fell. Midnight was long past, and morning
was approaching. Before leaving the tombstone,
Edward endeavoured to obtain a few minutes’ sleep.
He had just begun to doze, when he was awakened
by a weird and unearthly moaning. He listened.
The moaning became a stifled scream. The noise
grew louder and louder, until it rose into the highest
pitch of howling. What could it be? He was in
the home of the dead! Was it a ghost? Never!
His mind revolted from the wretched superstition.
He looked out to see what it could be; when something
light in colour dashed past like a flash, closely
followed by another and a darker object. After the
screaming had ceased, Edward again composed himself
to sleep, when he was wakened up by a sudden
rush over his legs. He looked up. The mystery
was solved! Two cats—a light and a dark one—had
been merely caterwauling in the graveyard, and making
night hideous according to their usual custom.</p>

<p>By this time the day was beginning to break, and
Edward prepared to leave his resting-place and resume
his labours. He felt very stiff as he crept from
under the tombstone, where he had been lying in a
cramped position. He was both cold and wet; but
his stiffness soon wore off; and after some smart running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the open air, his joints became a little more
flexible; and, shortly after, he returned home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MOTH-HUNTING.</i></div>

<p>Edward had frequent mishaps when he went out
on these nocturnal expeditions. One summer evening
he went out moth-hunting. The weather was mild
and fair; and it gave promise of an abundant “take”
of moths. He had with him his collecting-box under
his arm, and a phial of chloroform in his pocket. His
beat lay in a woody dale, close by the river’s side.
He paced the narrow footpath backward and forward,
snapping at his prey as he walked along the path.</p>

<p>The sun went down. The mellow thrush, which
had been pouring forth his requiem to the parting
day, was now silent. The lark flew to its mossy bed,
the swallow to its nest. The wood-pigeon had uttered
his last coo before settling down for the night. The
hum of the bee was no longer heard. The grasshopper
had sounded his last chirp; and all seemed
to have sunk to sleep. Yet Nature is never at rest.
The owl began to utter his doleful and melancholy
wail; the night-jar (<i>Caprimulgus Europæus</i>) was still
out with his spinning-wheel-like <i>birr</i>, <i>birr</i>; and the
lightsome roe, the pride of the lowland woods, was
emitting his favourite night bark.</p>

<p>The moths continued to appear long after the
butterflies had gone to rest. They crowded out from
their sylvan homes into the moth-catcher’s beat.
These he continued to secure. A little drop of the
drowsy liquid, and the insect dropped into his box, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
perfect as if still in Nature’s hands. Thus he managed
to secure a number of first-rate specimens—amongst
others, the Oak Egger moth, the Wood-Tiger moth, the
Cream-spot Tiger moth, the Bee-Hawk moth, the beautiful
China-mark, the Green Silver-line, and many
other specimens. He hoped to secure more; but in
the midst of his operations he was interrupted by the
approach of an extraordinary-looking creature.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TERRIBLE ENCOUNTER.</i></div>

<p>He was stepping slowly and watchfully along his
beat, crooning to himself, “There’s nae luck aboot
the house,” when, looking along the narrow footpath,
he observed something very large, and tremendously
long, coming towards him. He suddenly stopped his
crooning and came to a stand-still. What could the
hideous-looking monster be? He could not see it
clearly, for it had become dark, and the moon was not
yet up. Yet there it was, drawing slowly towards him.
He was totally unarmed. He had neither his gun nor
even his gully knife with him. Fear whispered, “Fly!
fly for your life!” but courage shouted, “No! no!
stand like a man and a true naturalist, and see the
worst and the best of it!” So he stood his ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FIGHT WITH BADGERS.</i></div>

<p>At length the animal gradually approached him.
He now observed that it consisted of three large and
full-grown badgers, each a short distance behind the
other, the foremost being only about sixteen yards
from where he stood. He had for some time been on
the look-out for a badger to add to his collection, and
now he hoped to be able to secure one. He rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
forward; the badgers suddenly turned and made for
the river alongside of which his beat had extended.
He wrapped a handkerchief round his hand to prevent
the animals biting him, threw off his hat, and bolted
after the badgers. He was gaining on them rapidly,
and as he came up with the last, which was bolting
down into the river, he gave it a tremendous kick;
but, in doing so, he fell suddenly flat on his back in
the midst of the path. When he came to himself he
began to feel if his legs were broken, or if his head
were still on. Yes, all was right; but, on searching,
he found a tremendous bump upon the back of his
head, as big as a turkey’s egg.</p>

<p>Such was the end of his night’s moth-hunting.
But his head was so full of badgers, and he was so
confused with his fall, that when he reached home and
went to sleep, he got up shortly afterwards, loaded his
gun for the purpose of shooting a badger, and, as he
was in the act of putting a cap on the nipple, he
suddenly awoke!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small><i>NIGHT WANDERERS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> it is comparatively easy to observe the
habits of animals by day, it is much more difficult to
do so at night. Edward, as we have already said, was
compelled by circumstances to work at shoemaking
by day, and to work at Natural History by night.</p>

<p>“It would have been much easier work for me,”
said Edward, in answer to an inquiry made as to his
nocturnal observations, “had it been my good fortune
to possess but a single trustworthy book on the subject,
or even a single friend who could have told me
anything about such matters. But I had neither book
nor friend. I was in a far worse predicament than
the young and intending communicants at the parish
church of Boyndie were, who, when asked a question by
the good and pious minister, and returning no answer,
were told that they were shockingly in the dark—all
in the dark together. Now, they had a light beside
them, for they had their teacher in their midst. But
I had no light whatever, and no instructor. It was
doubly dark with me. It was decidedly the very
blackness of darkness in my case. The only spark or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
glimmer I had was from within. It proceeded from
the never-ceasing craving I had for more knowledge
of the works of Nature. This was the only faintest
twinkle I had to lighten up my path, even in the
darkest night. And that little twinkle, together with
my own never-flagging perseverance, like a good and
earnest pilot, steered me steadily and unflinchingly
onward.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MIDNIGHT ROAMERS.</i></div>

<p>Although Edward was frequently out in winter-time,
especially in moonlight, his principal night-work
occurred between spring and autumn. The stillest
and quietest, and usually the darkest part of the night—unless
when the moon was up—was from about an
hour after sunset until about an hour before sunrise.
Yet, during that sombre time, when not asleep, he
seldom failed to hear the sounds or voices, near or at
a distance, of midnight wanderers prowling about. In
the course of a few years he learnt to know all the
beasts and birds of the district frequented by him.
He knew the former by their noises and gruntings, and
the latter by the sound of their wings when flying.
When a feathered wanderer flew by, he could tell
its call-note at once, and often the family as well as
the species to which it belonged. But although he contrived
to make himself acquainted with the objects of
many of these midnight cries and noises, others cost
him a great deal of time and labour, as well as some
dexterous manœuvring.</p>

<p>The sounds of the midnight roamers, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
appearance of the birds and animals, were invariably
more numerous during the earlier part of the year.
In the spring and early part of summer they were
always the most lively. Towards the end of summer
the sounds became fewer and less animated; and the
animals themselves did not appear so frequently.
Woods were the principal lodging-places of birds and
animals. There were fewer in the fields; still fewer
among the rocks or shingle by the sea-shore, except
in winter; and in the hills, the fewest of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROE-DEER AND HARE.</i></div>

<p>When he made his first night expeditions to the
inland country, the hoarse-like <i>bark</i> of the Roe-deer,
and the timid-like <i>bleak-bleak</i> of the Hare, puzzled
him very much. He attributed these noises to other
animals, before he was able by careful observation to
attribute them to their true sources. Although the
deer wanders about at all hours of the night, occasionally
grunting or barking, it does not usually feed
at that time. The hare, on the other hand, feeds
even during the darkest nights, and in spring and the
early part of summer it utters its low cry of <i>bleak-bleak</i>.
This cry is very different from that which it utters
when snared or half-shot. Its cry for help is then
most soul-pitying: it is like the tremulous voice of an
infant, even to the quivering of its little innocent lips.</p>

<p>While Edward found that the deer and the hare
were among the animals that wandered about a good
deal in the dark, he did not find that the Rabbit
was a night-roamer, although he occasionally saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it moving about by moonlight. He often watched the
rabbits going into their burrows at sunset; and he
also observed them emerging from them a little
before sunrise. But there was one thing about the
rabbit that perplexed and puzzled him. It did not
emit any cry, such as the hare does; but he often
heard the rabbit <i>tap-tap</i> in a particular manner. How
was this noise caused? He endeavoured to ascertain
the cause by close observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RABBIT.</i></div>

<p>Early one morning, when he was lying under a
whin bush, about twenty yards from the foot of a
sandy knoll, where there were plenty of rabbits’ holes,
he was startled by hearing a loud tap-tapping almost
close to where he lay! The streaks of day were just
beginning to appear. Parting the bush gently aside,
and looking through it, he observed a rabbit thud-thudding
its hind feet upon the ground close to the
mouth of another rabbit’s hole.</p>

<p>Edward continued to watch the rabbit. After he
had finished his tapping at the first hole, he went
along the hillock and began tap-tapping at another.
He went on again. He would smell the ground about
the hole first, and would sometimes pass without tapping.
At last he got to a hole where his progress
was stopped. After he had given only two or three
thuds, out rushed a full-grown rabbit, and flew at the
disturber of the peace. He rushed at him with such
fury that they both rolled headlong down hill, until
they reached the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A RABBIT-FIGHT.</i></div>

<p>There they had a rare set-to—a regular rabbit-fight.
Rabbits are fools at fighting. Their object seems
to be to leap over each other, and to kick the back
of their enemy’s head as they fly over; each trying
to jump the highest, and to kick the hardest. It is
a matter of jumping and kicking. Yet rabbits have
an immense power in their hinder feet. They often
knock each other down by this method of fighting.
They also occasionally fight like rams—knocking their
heads hard together. Then they reel and tumble, until
they recover, and are at it again, until one or the
other succumbs.</p>

<p>Edward is of opinion that the method pursued by
the male rabbits, of tapping in front of their neighbours’
holes, is to attract the attention of the females.
When the male comes out, instead of the female,
a fight occurs, such as that above described. At
other times, the rabbit that taps is joined by other
rabbits from the holes, and a friendly conference
takes place. But, besides this loud beating with
their heels, the rabbits possess another method of
communicating with their fellows. They produce a
sound like <i>tap-pat!</i> which is the sign of danger.
Edward often saw numbers of them frisking and
gambling merrily about the mouths of their burrows,
but when the sound of <i>tap-pat</i> was heard, the whole
of the rabbits, young and old, rushed immediately
to their holes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FOX.</i></div>

<p>Amongst the true night-roamers are the fox, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
otter, the badger, the polecat, the stoat, the weasel,
the hedgehog, the rat, and almost the whole family
of mice. These are, for the most part, nocturnal in
their habits. No matter how dark or tempestuous
the night, they are constantly prowling about.
Even at the sea-shore,—the otter, the weasel, and the
mice, often paid Edward a visit. When on the hills
or moors, he often saw the weasel, and sometimes
the fox; but the fields and the sides of woods were
the places where they were most frequently met with.
All these animals, like the deer and hare, have their
peculiar and individual calls, which they utter at
night.</p>

<p>Thus the Fox may be known by his <i>bark</i>, which resembles
that of a poodle dog, with a little of the yelp in
it; and he repeats this at intervals varying from about
six to eighteen minutes between each. When suddenly
surprised, the fox gives vent to a sharp harsh-like
growl, and shows and snaps his teeth. “I once,”
says Edward, “put my walking-staff into the mouth
of a fox just roused from his lair—for foxes do not
always live in holes—to see how the fellow would
act. He worried the stick and took it away with
him. I have, on three different occasions, come upon
two foxes occupying the same lair at the same time—twice
on the cliffs by the sea, and once among
the bushes in an old and disused quarry. In one
instance I came upon them in mid-winter, and in the
other two cases during summer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CRIES OF NIGHT-ROAMERS.</i></div>

<p>The Badger utters a kind of snarling <i>grunt</i>. This
is done in quick succession. Then he is silent for a
short time, and again he begins in the same strain.
The Otter, and most of the other night-roamers, have
a sort of <i>squeak</i>, which they utter occasionally. But
though there is a difference between them, which
Edward could distinguish, it is very difficult to describe
it in words. Their screams, however, differ
widely from their ordinary call. The scream is the
result of alarm or pain, perhaps of a sudden wound;
the call is their nightly greeting when they hold
friendly converse with each other; but the difference
in the screams can only be learnt by the ear, and can
scarcely be described by words.</p>

<p>The Field Mice—the “wee timorous beasties” of
Burns—besides their squeaking, lilt a low and not
unmusical ditty for hours together. Edward often
heard them about him, sometimes quite near him,
sometimes beneath his head. He occasionally tried
to clutch them, but on opening his hand he found
it filled with grass, moss, or leaves. The result of
his observations was, that several, if not the whole of
the mouse race, are possessed, more or less, of the
gift of singing.</p>

<p>The otter, polecat, stoat, and weasel, have a knack
of <i>blowing</i> or <i>hizzing</i> when suddenly come upon, or
when placed at bay. The three latter stand up on
their hind feet in a menacing attitude. Sometimes
they suddenly dart forward and give battle when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
they see no other way of escape. This is especially
the case with the females when they have their young
about them. Edward once saw a weasel, after hiding
her family amongst a cairn of stones, ascend to the
top, and muttering something all the while, by her
threatening attitude and fierce showing of her teeth,
dared any one to approach her under penalty of immediate
attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IMPERTINENCE OF WEASELS.</i></div>

<p>A bite of a weasel, or polecat, or badger, or otter,
is anything but agreeable. The bites of the weasel
and the polecat are the worst. There seems to be
some poison in their bites, for the part bitten soon
becomes inflamed, and the bite is long in healing.
The whole of this group of animals are of the
same bold, fearless, and impetuous disposition. They
are also remarkably impertinent and aggressive, not
hesitating to attack man himself, especially when
they see him showing the slightest symptoms of cowardice.
Take the following illustrations, communicated
by Edward himself:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ATTACK BY A WEASEL.</i></div>

<p>“Returning one morning from an excursion in the
Buchan district, when between Fraserburgh and
Pennan, I felt so completely exhausted by fatigue,
want of sleep, and want of food (for my haversack had
become exhausted), that I went into a field near the
road, lay down by a dyke-side, and fell fast asleep. I
had not slept long, however, when I was awakened by
something cold pressing in betwixt my forehead and
the edge of my hat. There were some small birds in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
hat which I had shot, and they were wrapped in wadding.
On putting up my hand to ascertain the meaning,
I got hold of a Weasel, which had been trying to
force its way in to the birds. I threw him away to
some distance amongst the grass, and went to sleep
again. The fellow came back in a few minutes, and
began the same trick. I gripped him hard this time,
and tossed him across the dyke<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> into another field,
but not before he had bitten my hands. I began to
close my eyes once more, when again the prowler
approached. At last, despairing of peace, I left the
spot where I had been seated, and went into a small
plantation about a hundred yards off, and now, I
thought, I would surely get a nap in comfort. But
the weasel would not be refused. He had followed
in my track. I had scarcely closed my eyes before
he was at me again. He was trying to get into my
hat. I awoke and shoved him off. Again he tried
it, and again he escaped. By this time I was thoroughly
awake. I was a good deal nettled at the
pertinacity of the brute, and yet could not help admiring
his perseverance. But, thinking it was now
high time to put an end to the game, instead of falling
asleep, I kept watch. Back he came, nothing
daunted by his previous repulses. I suffered him to
go on with his operations until I found my hat about
to roll off. I then throttled, and eventually strangled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the audacious little creature, though my hand was
again bitten severely. After getting a few winks of
sleep, I was again able to resume my journey.”</p>

<p>Edward was once attacked by two pertinacious
Rats in a similar manner. He was making an excursion
between Banff and Aberdeen, and had got to a
place near Slains Castle, beyond Peterhead. It had
been raining all day. It was now growing dark; and
he looked about for a place to sleep in. He observed
a dilapidated building, which looked like the ruins
of a threshing-mill, as it stood near a farm-steading.
He entered the place, and found only a small part of
the roof still standing. It was, however, sufficient to
protect him from the rain, which was still falling.
There was a pile of stones and rubbish immediately
under the roof, and having gathered together as much
dry grass as he could find, and spread it on the stones,
he lay down in a reclining position. In this position
he soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A BAD NIGHT’S SLEEP.</i></div>

<p>How long he had slept he did not know; but he
was awakened by a quivering sort of motion about
his head. He at first thought it was caused by
the sinking of the stones, and that his head was going
down with them. He sat bolt upright, clutched his
gun and wallet to save them, and felt the stones with
his hands to ascertain whether they had sunk or not.
They were quite undisturbed. He again lay down,
thinking that he had only been dreaming. But
before he could fall asleep, the movement under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
head again commenced. Thinking it might be a
weasel, and not wishing for his company, he moved
to one side, adjusted his bedding, moved the grass,
and prepared to lie down again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PERTINACIOUS RATS.</i></div>

<p>His sleep this time was of very short duration, for
the tug-tugging again commenced. He now raised
his hand, at the same time that he opened his eyes,
and seized hold, not of a weasel, but of a rat. He
threw him away, thinking that that would be enough.
Being assured that there were no weasels there—for
rats and weasels never associate—he now thought he
should be able to get a little sleep. He had no idea
that the rat would return.</p>

<p>But in this he was disappointed. He was just
beginning to sleep when he heard the rat again.
He looked up, and found that two rats were approaching
him. So long as there were only two, he knew
he could manage them. He allowed them to climb
up the stones and smell all about him. One of them
mounted his face, and sat upon it. They next proceeded
to his wallet, and endeavoured to pull it from
under his head. They had almost succeeded in doing
so, when he laid hold of his wallet and drove them
off.</p>

<p>Being now in a sort of fossilised state from wet
and cold, Edward did not attempt to sleep again, but
rose up from his bed of stones, secured all his things,
and marched away to recover his animal heat and
resume his explorations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE OTTER.</i></div>

<p>Speaking of the Otter as a night-roamer, Edward
observes:—“I am not aware who first burlesqued the
Otter as an amphibious animal. He must have
known very little of the animal’s true habits, and
nothing at all of its anatomical structure. The error
thus promulgated seems to have taken deep root.
That the Otter is aquatic in habits is well known.
He goes into the water to fish, but he is forced to
come up again to breathe. In fact, a very small portion
of the Otter’s life is spent in the water. There
are many birds that are far more aquatic than the
Otter. There are some, indeed, that never leave the
water night nor day; yet no one calls them amphibious
birds. I have seen the Otter, in his free, unfettered,
and unmolested condition, both in the sea
and the river, go into the water, and disappear many
a time, and I have often watched for his reappearance.
The longest time that he remained under water was
from three to four minutes; the usual time was from
two to three minutes. I have also watched numbers
of water birds, who have also to descend for their
food, and I must say that the greater number of them
exceed the Otter in the time that they remain below
water. Some of them remain double the time. I
once saw a Great Northern Diver remain below water
more than nine minutes. A porpoise that I once
watched, remained down about ten minutes; and so
on with other sea-birds and animals.”</p>

<p>Many of these night-roaming animals—such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
weasel, rat, badger, otter, and polecat—are seen during
the day; but these may only be regarded as stray individuals,
their principal feeding time being at night.
The rat may forage in the daytime, and the weasel is
sometimes to be seen hunting when the sun is high.
But there was one circumstance in connection with the
manners and habits of these creatures which surprised
Edward not a little, which was,—that although he
very seldom saw any of them in the evening, or until
after it was dark,—he never missed seeing them in the
morning, and sometimes after it had become daylight.
The same remark is, in a measure, applicable to many
of the night insects, to land crustaceans, beetles, many
of the larger moths, sandhoppers, and slaters.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CASTLE OF THE BOYNE.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FUMART.</i></div>

<p>One of the most severe encounters that Edward
ever had with a nocturnal roamer was with a Polecat
or Fumart<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in the ruined castle of the Boyne.
The polecat is of the same family as the weasel, but
it is longer, bigger, and stronger. It is called Fumart
because of the fœtid odour which it emits when
irritated or attacked. It is an extremely destructive
brute, especially in the poultry-yard, where it kills
far more than it eats. Its principal luxury seems to
be to drink the blood and suck the brains of the
animals it kills. It destroys everything that the gamekeeper
wishes to preserve. Hence the destructive
war that is so constantly waged against the polecat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOYNE CASTLE.</i></div>

<p>The ruined castle of the Boyne, about five miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
west of Banff, was one of Edward’s favourite night
haunts. The ruins occupy the level summit of a
precipitous bank forming the eastern side of a ravine,
through which the little river Boyne flows. One of the
vaults, level with the ground, is used as a sheltering
place for cattle. Here Edward often took refuge
during rain, or while the night was too dark to
observe. The cattle soon got used to him. When
the weather was dry, and the animals fed or slept
outside, Edward had the vault to himself. On such
occasions he was visited by rats, rabbits, owls, weasels,
polecats, and other animals.</p>

<p>One night, as he was lying upon a stone, dozing
or sleeping, he was awakened by something pat-patting
against his legs. He thought it must be a
rabbit or a rat, as he knew that they were about the
place. He only moved his legs a little, so as to drive
the creature away. But the animal would not go.
Then he raised himself up, and away it went; but the
night was so dark that he did not see what the animal
was. Down he went again to try and get a sleep;
but before a few minutes had elapsed, he felt the
same pat-patting; on this occasion it was higher
up his body. He now swept his hand across his
breast, and thrust the intruder off. The animal
shrieked as it fell to the ground. Edward knew the
shriek at once. It was a Polecat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAITS FOR THE POLECAT.</i></div>

<p>He shifted his position a little, so as to be opposite
the doorway, where he could see his antagonist betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
him and the sky. He also turned upon his side in
order to have more freedom to act. He had in one of
his breast pockets a water-hen which he had shot that
evening; and he had no doubt that this was the bait
which attracted the polecat. He buttoned up his
coat to his chin, so as to prevent the bird from being
carried away by force. He was now ready for whatever
might happen. Edward must tell the rest of
the story in his own words:—</p>

<p>“Well, just as I hoped and expected, in about
twenty minutes I observed the fellow entering the
vault, looking straight in my direction. He was very
cautious at first. He halted, and looked behind him.
He turned a little, and looked out. I could easily
have shot him now, but that would have spoilt the
sport; besides, I never wasted my powder and shot
upon anything that I could take with my hands.
Having stood for a few seconds, he slowly advanced,
keeping his nose on the ground. On he came. He
put his fore-feet on my legs, and stared me full in
the face for about a minute. I wondered what he
would do next,—whether he would come nearer or go
away. When satisfied with his look at my face, he
dropped his feet and ran out of the vault. I was a
good deal disappointed; and I feared that my look
had frightened him. By no means. I was soon
reassured by hearing the well-known and ominous
<i>squeak-squeak</i> of the tribe. It occurred to me that I
was about to be assaulted by a legion of polecats, and
that it might be best to beat a retreat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FIGHT WITH THE POLECAT.</i></div>

<p>“I was just in the act of rising, when I saw my
adversary once more make his appearance at the
entrance. He seemed to be alone. I slipped quietly
down again to my former position, and waited his
attack. After a rather slow and protracted march,
in the course of which he several times turned his
head towards the door—a manœuvre which I did
not at all like—he at last approached me. He at
once leapt upon me, and looked back towards the
entrance. I lifted my head, and he looked full
in my face. Then he leapt down, and ran to the
entrance once more, and gave a <i>squeak</i>. No answer.
He returned, and leapt upon me again. He was
now in a better position than before, but not
sufficiently far up for my purpose. Down went his
nose, and up, up he crawled over my body towards
the bird in my breast pocket. His head was low
down, so that I couldn’t seize him.</p>

<p>“I lay as still as death; but, being forced to
breathe, the movement of my chest made the brute
raise his head, and at that moment I gript him by the
throat! I sprang instantly to my feet, and held on.
But I actually thought that he would have torn my
hands to pieces with his claws. I endeavoured to
get him turned round, so as to get my hand to the
back of his neck. Even then, I had enough to do to
hold him fast. How he screamed and yelled! What
an unearthly noise in the dead of night! The vault
rung with his howlings! And then what an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stench he emitted during his struggles! The very
jackdaws in the upper stories of the castle began to
<i>caw!</i> Still I kept my hold. But I could not prevent
his yelling at the top of his voice. Although I
gripped and squeezed with all my might and main,
I could not choke him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE POLECAT CHLOROFORMED.</i></div>

<p>“Then I bethought me of another way of dealing
with the brute. I had in my pocket about an ounce
of chloroform, which I used for capturing insects. I
took the bottle out, undid the cork, and thrust the
ounce of chloroform down the fumart’s throat. It
acted as a sleeping draught. He gradually lessened
his struggles. Then I laid him down upon a stone,
and, pressing the iron heel of my boot upon his neck,
I dislocated his spine, and he struggled no more. I
was quite exhausted when the struggle was over.
The fight must have lasted nearly two hours. It was
the most terrible encounter that I ever had with an
animal of his class. My hands were very much
bitten and scratched; and they long continued inflamed
and sore. But the prey I had captured was
well worth the struggle. He was a large and powerful
animal—a male; and I desired to have him as a
match for a female which I had captured some time
before. He was all the more valuable, as I succeeded
in taking him without the slightest injury to
his skin.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The Birds that roam at night are more easily described.
Although the Bat comes out pretty early
in the evenings, it is not on night insects that he
chiefly feeds. It is rather on the day insects which
have not yet gone home to their rest. The bat flies
mostly at twilight, and inhabits ruins and buildings
as well as hollow trees in the woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LONG-EARED OWL.</i></div>

<p>The Owl is a nocturnal bird of prey. It flits by,
as the twilight deepens into night, and hoots or
howls in hollow and lugubrious tones. Though
Edward was by no means given to fear, he was once
scared at midnight by the screech of a Long-eared owl
(<i>Strix otus</i>). It was only about the third or fourth
night that he had gone out in search of specimens.
When he began his night-work, he was sometimes a
little squeamish; but, as he became accustomed to it,
he slept quite as soundly out of doors as in bed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was as fearless by night as by day. No thought of
ghosts, hobgoblins, water-kelpies, brownies, fairies, or
the other supposed spirits of darkness, ever daunted
him. But, on this particular night, he had one of the
most alarming and fearful awakenings that he had
ever experienced.</p>

<p>There had been a fearful thunderstorm, during
which he had taken shelter in a hole in the woods of
Mountcoffer. He had fallen asleep with his head upon
the lock of his gun. Before he entered the burrow, he
had caught a field-mouse, which he wished to take home
alive. He therefore tied a string round its tail, attaching
the other end of the string (which was about six
feet long) to his waistcoat. The little fellow had thus
the liberty of the length of his tether.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE OWL’S SCREECHES.</i></div>

<p>While Edward was sleeping soundly, he was
awakened by something tug-tugging at his waistcoat;
and then by hearing a terrific series of yells, mingled
with screeches, close at his head. He was confused
and bewildered at first, and did not know where he
was, or what the dreadful noises meant. Recovering
his recollection, and opening his eyes, he looked
about him. He remembered the mouse, and pulled
back the string to which it had been attached. The
mouse was gone. Nothing but the skin of its tail
remained. He looked up, and saw an Owl sitting on
a tree a few yards off. He had doubtless begun to
scream when he found that his capture of the mouse
was resisted by the string attached to its tail. Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
emerged a little from his burrow, and drew out
his gun for the purpose of shooting the owl; but,
before he could do this, the owl had taken to his wings
and fled away with his booty.</p>

<p>Besides the Long-eared owl, Edward also met with
the Brown owl,—the only two species that he met
with in his district, or of which he can speak from
personal observation. Both of these owls uttered a
<i>too-hoo</i> when sinking down upon their prey; and,
after they had secured it, they would fly away
without any further noise; but, if obstructed, they
would both set up a loud screech. Edward had
many opportunities of witnessing this trait in their
characters. The best instance occurred in the wood
of Backlaw.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN ORCHESTRA DISTURBED.</i></div>

<p>“Near the centre of this wood,” he observes, “and
not far from the farm of the same name, there is a
small piece of stagnant water. I was reclining against
a tree one night, listening to a reptilian choir—a concert
of frogs. It was delicious to hear the musicians
endeavouring to excel each other in their strains, and
to exhibit their wonderful vocal powers. The defect
of the concert was the want of time. Each individual
performer endeavoured to get as much above the
concert pitch as possible. It was a most beautiful
night,—for there are beautiful nights as well as days
in the north,—and I am certain that these creatures
were enjoying its beauty as much as myself. Presently,
when the whole of the vocalists had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
their highest notes, they became hushed in an instant.
I was amazed at this, and began to wonder at the
sudden termination of the concert. But, looking
about, I observed a Brown Owl drop down, with the
silence of death, on to the top of a low dyke close by
the orchestra.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BROWN OWL.</i></div>

<p>“He sat there for nearly half an hour, during which
there was perfect silence. The owl himself remained
quite motionless, for I watched him all the time.
Then I saw the owl give a hitch, and move his head a
little to one side. He instantly darted down amongst
the grass and rushes, after which he rose with something
dangling from his claws. It was a frog: I saw
it quite distinctly. He flew up to a tree behind the
one against which I was leaning. I turned round a
little, and looked up to see how the owl would proceed
with his quarry; whether he would tear him in
pieces, or gobble him up whole. In this, however, I
was disappointed. Although I moved very quietly,
the quick eye or ear of the owl detected me, and I
was at once greeted with his <i>hoolie-gool-oo-oo</i> as loud
as he could scream. I might have shot him; but
my stock of powder and lead was very low, and I
refrained. Besides, he soon put it out of my power
by taking wing and flying off with his prey.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NIGHT BIRDS.</i></div>

<p>There were two other birds which Edward often
observed prowling about in the twilight in search of
food,—namely, the Kestrel and Merlin. On one
occasion he shot a specimen of the latter, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was so dark that he could scarcely see it. He did
not know that it was a hawk. He thought it was a
goatsucker by its flight. Many of the birds of prey
roamed about by night as well as by day. The harsh
<i>scream</i> of the heron, the <i>quack</i> of the wild duck, the
<i>piping</i> of the kittyneedy (common sandpiper), the
<i>birbeck</i> of the muirfowl, the <i>wail</i> of the plover, the
<i>curlee</i> of the curlew, and the <i>boom</i> of the snipe, were
often heard at night, in the regions frequented by
these birds. Then again, by the sea-side, he would
hear by night the shrill <i>piping</i> of the redshank and
ring-dotterel, and the <i>pleck-pleck</i> of the oyster-catcher,
as they came down from their breeding-grounds to
the shore, to feed or to hold their conclaves.</p>

<p>The Coot and Water-hen sometimes get very noisy
after sunset. The Landrail <i>craiks</i> the whole night
through, until some time after the sun rises. The
Partridge too either moves about or is on the alert
during spring and summer, as may be known by its
often repeated <i>twirr-twirr</i>. “The only bird we have
here,” says Edward, “that attempts to give music at
the dead hours of night, is the Sedge-warbler. It
appears to be possessed of the gift of song during the
night as well as the day, and it is by no means niggardly
in exercising its vocal powers.</p>

<p>“Well do I remember,” he continues, “how the
little mill-worker, of scarcely ten years of age, was
struck with admiration and almost bewildered with
delight, at the first of this species he had ever heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
exhibiting its mimicking powers; whereas now, I
considered this to be neither more nor less than the
bird’s own natural melody. And if there be any
change in the delight with which I hear the Sedge-warbler,
although I have now turned the corner of
ten times six, and have become an old cobbler instead
of a juvenile factory operative, yet when I hear the
little songster, I drink in the pleasure with even
greater delight than I did in those long-past years.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROOK.</i></div>

<p>The Rook, too, is in a measure nocturnal in his
habits during a certain term of the year, especially
when building his nest or when bringing up his progeny.
From the time when the foundation of the nest
has been laid, to the end of the matrimonial proceedings
for the year, and until the last chick has left the
nest, the rookery is in a state of continual <i>caw-cawing</i>
from morning till night. As the young brood of
rooks grow up, their appetites increase, and hence
the incessant labour of their parents in scouring the
country for worms and grubs to furnish them with
their late supper or their early morning breakfast.</p>

<p>“I once,” says Edward, “during one of my country
excursions, slept beside a very large rookery in the
woods of Forglen. Slept? no, I could not sleep!
I never was in the midst of such a hideous bedlam of
cawings. I positively do not believe that a single
member of that black fraternity slept during the
whole of that night. At least I didn’t. If the hubbub
slackened for a moment, it was only renewed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
redoubled vehemence and energy. I found the
rookery in the evening in the wildest uproar, and I
left it in the morning in the same uproarious condition.
I took good care never to make my bed so
near a rookery again. Still, in all justice, I must
give the rook the very first and highest character for
attention to its young. It is first out in the morning
to search for food, and the last to provide for its
family at night. The starling is very dutiful in that
way; but the rook beats him hollow.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SONGSTERS AT NIGHT.</i></div>

<p>“As a rule,” says Edward, “so far as I have been
able to observe, the Skylark is the first songster in the
morning, and the Corn-bunting the last at night. It
was no uncommon thing to hear the lark carolling his
early hymn of praise high up in the heavens, before
there was any appearance of light, or before I thought
of rising to recommence my labours. Nor was it
unusual to hear the bunting stringing together his
few and humble notes into an evening song long
after sunset, and after I had been compelled to succumb
from want of light to pursue my researches.
So far as I can remember, I do not think that I have
heard the Skylark sing after sundown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MORNING SERVICE OF SONG.</i></div>

<p>“Amongst the sylvan choristers, the Blackbird is
the foremost in wakening the grove to melody, and he
is also among the latest to retire at night. As soon
as the first streaks of grey begin to tinge the sky,
and break in through the branches amidst which
he nestles, the Blackbird is up, and from the topmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bough of the tree he salutes the newborn day. And
when all the rest of the birds have ended their daily
service of song and retired to rest, he still continues
to tune his mellow throat, until darkness has fairly
settled down upon the earth.</p>

<img src="images/image128.jpg" width="402" height="198" alt="city in far distance" />
<div class="caption">FRASERBURGH.</div>
</div>

<p>“After the Skylark and Blackbird have heralded
the coming day, the Thrush rises from her couch and
pours out her melodious notes. The Chaffinch, the
Willow-wren, and all the lesser songsters, then join
the choir, and swell the chorus of universal praise.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small><i>FORMS A NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Banff</span> was the central point of Edward’s operations.
Banff is a pleasant country town, situated on the
southern shore of the Moray Firth. It lies on a
gentle slope inclining towards the sea. In front of
it is the harbour. Although improved by Telford, it
is rather difficult of access and not much frequented
except during the fishing season. Westward of Banff,
a low range of hills lies along the coast. The burns
of the Boyne, Portsoy, and Cullen cross the range,
and run into the sea.</p>

<p>The fishing town of Macduff, which may be considered
the port of Banff, lies about a mile to the eastward.
To reach it, the river Deveron is crossed by one
of Smeaton’s finest bridges. The harbour of Macduff
is more capacious and more easy of entrance than
that of Banff. Many foreign vessels are to be seen
there in the fishing season, for the purpose of transporting
the myriads of herrings which are daily
brought in by the fishermen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLIFFS OF GAMRIE.</i></div>

<p>Eastward of Macduff, the coast becomes exceedingly
rocky. The ridges of the hills, running down
towards the sea, seem to have been broken off by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the tremendous lashings of the waves at their feet, and
thus the precipitous rocks descend in several places
about six hundred feet to the shore. The coast scenery
at Gamrie is unrivalled on the eastern shores of Scotland.
The cliffs are the haunts of myriads of sea-fowl.
“On a fine day,” says Edward, “and under
the mild influence of a vernal and unclouded sun, the
scene is particularly beautiful. The ocean lies tranquil,
and stretched out before the spectator like an
immense sheet of glass, smiling in its soft and azure
beauty, while over its surface the kittywake, the guillemot,
the razor-bill, and the puffin, conspicuous by
the brilliant orange and scarlet of its bill and legs, are
beheld wheeling with rapid wing in endless and
varying directions. On firing a gun the effect is
startling. The air is immediately darkened with the
multitudes of birds which are roused by the report.
The ear is stunned by the varied and discordant
sounds which arise. The wailing note of the kittywake,
the shrill cry of the tammy-norie, and the
hoarse voice of the guillemot, resembling, as it were,
the laugh of some demon in mockery of the intrusion
of man amid these majestic scenes of nature;—all
these combined, and mingled occasionally with the
harsh scream of the cormorant, are heard above the
roar of the ocean, which breaks at the foot of these
tremendous and gigantic precipices.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FISHING-BOAT FLEETS.</i></div>

<p>The view from the heights of Gamrie on a summer
evening is exceedingly fine. The sea ripples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
beneath you. Far away it is as smooth as glass.
During the herring season, the fishing-boats shoot
out from the rocky clefts in which the harbours are
formed. Underneath are the fishing-boats of Gardenstown;
to the right those of Crovie. Eastward,
you observe the immense fleet of Fraserburgh vessels,
about a thousand in number, creeping out to sea.
Westward, are the fishing-boats of Macduff, of
Banff, Whitehills, Portsoy, Cullen, Sandend, Findochtie,
and the Buckies, all making their appearance
by degrees. The whole horizon becomes covered
with fleets of fishing-boats. Across the Moray Firth,
in the far distance, the Caithness mountains are relieved
against the evening sky. The hills of Morven
and the Maiden’s Pap are distinctly visible. The sun,
as it descends, throws a gleam of molten gold across
the bosom of the firth. A few minutes more and the
sun goes down, leaving the toilers of the sea to pursue
their labours amidst the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Gamrie Head is locally called Mohr Head.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The
bay of Gamrie is a picturesque indentation of the
coast, effected by the long operation of water upon
rocks of unequal solidity. The hills, which descend
to the coast, are composed of hard grauwacke, in
which is deeply inlaid a detached strip of mouldering
old red sandstone. The waves of the German Ocean,
by perpetual lashing against the coast, have washed
out the sandstone, and left the little bay of Gamrie—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
solid grauwacke standing out in bold promontories—Mohr
Head on the one side, and Crovie Head
on the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GARDENSTOWN AND CROVIE.</i></div>

<p>The fishing village of Gardenstown lies at the foot
of the Gamrie cliffs. It is reached by a steep winding
path down the face of the brae. The road descends
from terrace to terrace. The houses look like
eyries, built on ledges in the recesses of the cliff. As
you proceed towards the shore, you seem to look down
the chimneys of the houses beneath. The lower and
older part of the village is close to the sea. The
harbour seems as if made in a cleft of the rocks.
The fishers of this village are a fine race of men,
with a grand appearance. They are thorough Northmen;
and but for their ancestors having settled at
Gamrie, they might have settled in Normandy and
“come in with the Conqueror” at the other end of
the island.</p>

<p>A little eastward of Gardenstown is the little fishing
village of Crovie, containing another colony of
Northmen. Farther out to sea is the majestic headland
of Troup. It is the home of multitudes of
sea-birds. Its precipices are penetrated with caves
and passages, of which the most remarkable are
Hell’s Lum and the Needle’s Eye. Hell’s Lum<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
consists of a ghastly opening on the slope of the
hill near Troup Head. From this opening to the
sea there is a subterranean passage about a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
yards long, up which, on the occasion of a storm,
the waves are forced with great fury, until they
find their escape by the “Lum” in the shape of
dense spray. The other opening, the Needle’s Eye,
runs quite through the peninsular rocky height. It
is about a hundred and fifty yards long, and is so
narrow that only one person at a time can with difficulty
make his way through it.</p>

<p>Eastward of Troup Head the scenery continues of
the same character. The fishing village of Pennan,
like Gardenstown, lies at the foot of a ledge of precipitous
rocks, and is enclosed by a little creek or
bay. From the summit of the Red Head of Pennan
the indentations of the coast are seen to Kinnaird’s
Head in the east, and to the Bin Hill of Cullen in
the west.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NORTHERN DENS.</i></div>

<p>The scenery of this neighbourhood, besides its
ruggedness and wildness, is rendered beautiful by the
Glens or Dens which break through the ridges of
rock, and form deep ravines,—each having its little
streamlet at the bottom, winding its way to the
sea. The water is overhung by trees or brushwood,
sometimes by boulders or grey rocks like buttresses,
which seem to support the walls of the Den. These
winding hollows are rich to luxuriance with plants
and flowers,—a very garden of delight to the botanist.
Heaths, furze, primroses, wild rasps, wild strawberries,
whortleberries, as well as many rare plants, are to be
found there; whilst the songsters of the grove—thrushes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
blackbirds, and linnets—haunt the brushwood
in varying numbers.</p>

<div class="caption">BAY OF ABERDOUR.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEN OF ABERDOUR.</i></div>

<p>The most picturesque and interesting of these
Dens are those of Troup, Auchmedden, and Aberdour.
The Dens, when followed inland, are found to
branch out into various lesser Dens, until they become
lost in the moors and mosses of the interior.
The Den of Aberdour is particularly beautiful. At
its northern extremity, near where it opens upon the
sea, the rift in the glen is almost overhung by the
ruins of the ancient Church of Aberdour,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
have been founded by St. Columbanus, who landed
on this part of the coast to convert the pagan population
to Christianity. The bay of Aberdour, with
its bold headland, forms the sea entrance to this
picturesque valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COAST-LINE OF BANFFSHIRE.</i></div>

<p>The coast-line of Banffshire, without regarding
the indentations of the bays, extends for about thirty
miles along the southern shores of the Moray Firth.
This was the principal scene of Edward’s explorations.
His rounds usually extended coastwise, for about seven
miles in one direction, and about six in another. He
also went inland for six miles. But he very often
exceeded these limits, as we shall afterwards find.</p>

<p>Having referred to the coast-line, we may also
briefly refer to the inland portion of the county.
Banffshire is of an irregular shape, and extends from
the southern shores of the Moray Firth in a south-westerly
direction toward Cairngorm and Ben Macdhui,—the
highest mountain knot of the Grampians.
The middle portion of the county is moderately
hilly. Glen Fiddick, Glen Isla, and Strath Deveron,
follow the line of hills which descend in a north-westerly
direction from the Grampians towards the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">MAP OF BANFFSHIRE</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COUNTY OF BANFF.</i></div>

<p>The county generally is under cultivation of the
highest order. The valleys are intersected with rich
meadows and pasture-lands, which are stocked with
cattle of the choicest breeds. There are numerous
woods and plantations, both luxuriant and verdant,
though there is a great want of hedges. Agriculture
is gradually extending upwards towards the mountains.
Moors and morasses are fast disappearing.
In places where the wail of the Plover, the birr of
the Moorcock, and the scream of the Merlin, were
the only sounds,—the mellow voice of the Lark, the
Mavis, and the Blackbird, are now to be heard in the
fields and the woods throughout the country.</p>

<div class="caption">AND NORTH ABERDEENSHIRE.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEN MACDHUI.</i></div>

<p>In the extreme south-western district lies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
great mountain knot to which we have already referred.
The scenery of this neighbourhood can scarcely
be equalled, even in Switzerland, though it is at present
almost entirely unknown. Cairngorm, Benbuinach,
Benaven, and Ben Macdhui, surround Loch
Avon and the forest of Glen Avon. The Banffshire
side of Ben Macdhui forms a magnificent precipice
of 1500 feet, which descends sheer down into the
loch. This lonely and solemn lake is fed by the
streams flowing from the snows that lie all the
year round in the corries of the mountains above.
These streams leap down from the bare and jagged
cliffs in the form of broken cataracts. One of these
falls has a descent of 900 feet. The parish of Kirkmichael,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in which this scenery occurs, is almost unpeopled.
It has only one village—Tomintoul—the
highest in Scotland. The people who inhabit it and
the other hamlets of the parish, are of a different race
and religion, and speak a different language, from
those who inhabit the middle and lower parts of the
county.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S ROUNDS.</i></div>

<p>To return to the labours of our Naturalist. For
about fifteen years Edward made the greater part of
his researches at night. He made them in the late
evening and in the early morning, snatching his sleep
at intervals between the departing night and the
returning day.</p>

<p>His rounds, we have said, extended coastwise along
the shore of the Moray Firth, for about seven miles in
one direction, and about six in another. His excursions
also extended inland for about five or six miles.
He had thus three distinct circuits. Although he
only took one of them at a time, he usually managed
to visit each district twice a week.</p>

<p>Having sometimes wandered too far, as he frequently
did, he divested himself of his hunting paraphernalia,
rolled them up together, hid them in a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
or some convenient place, and then ran home as fast
as he could, in order to be at his work at the proper
time. He once ran three miles in twenty minutes.
He measured the time by his watch,—for he had a
watch then, though, like himself, it is worn out now.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when kept late at work, he was
prevented from enjoying his evening ramble. After
going to bed, and taking a short sleep, he would set
out in the dark, in order to be at the place where
he had appointed; from whence he worked his way
homeward in the morning towards Banff.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TWO GEESE.</i></div>

<p>But though he made it a general practice during
his nightly excursions to return home in time for
the morning’s work, he occasionally found it necessary
to deviate a little from this rule. When he was
in search of some particular bird, he was never satisfied
or at rest until he had obtained it. On one
occasion two Geese, the first of their kind that he had
ever seen, caused him to lose nearly a whole week
before he could run them down.</p>

<p>He first saw them whilst walking out one Sunday
afternoon. They were swimming about on a piece
of water near the town. He went out before daylight
next morning to the same place. But he saw
no geese. He waited for an hour, and then they made
their appearance. They alighted on the water within
a short distance of the bar, where he was sitting. Had
his object been to secure them at once, he could easily
have shot them, for they were both within reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his gun. But he wished to observe their habits, and
he waited for some time. Having satisfied himself
on this head, he next endeavoured to possess them.
He shot one of them; the other flew away.</p>

<p>He now desired to possess the other bird; but it
was with extreme difficulty that he could accomplish
his object. Though the goose returned, it was so
extremely shy that it could scarcely be approached.
It was only by making use of many precautions, and
resorting to some very curious stratagems, that Edward
was able to capture the bird. A week elapsed
before he could secure it. He shot it on Saturday;
but he did not recover it until the following morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LITTLE STINT.</i></div>

<p>On another occasion a Little Stint (the least of
the Sandpipers) cost him two days and a night. It
was the first bird of the kind he had ever seen,—and
it was the last. Though he was occasionally
within a mile or two of Banff during the pursuit of
the bird, and though he had not tasted food during
the whole of his absence, lying during part of the
night amongst the shingle on the sea-shore, yet he
never once thought of leaving the chase until final
success crowned his efforts. We must allow him
to tell the story in his own words.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLOCK OF BIRDS.</i></div>

<p>“I once had a desperate hunt after a Little Stint
(<i>Tringa minuta</i>). Returning home one evening along
the links,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I heard a strange cry coming, as it seemed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from the shore. I listened for some time, as I knew
it was the season (September) for many of our migratory
species to visit us. Never having heard the cry
before, I was speedily on the beach. But it was growing
dark, and I had not cat’s eyes. The sound, too,
ceased so soon as I had gained the beach. After
groping about for some time, I thought I espied a
rather large flock of birds at some distance along the
shore. I approached cautiously, and found that I
was correct; the flock consisting chiefly of ringed
plovers, dunlins, and sanderlings. From the latter
circumstance, and from the fact that the cry was that
of a sandpiper, I was pretty sure that a stranger was
amongst them. Although I could see well enough
that the birds were on the wet sand between me
and the water, I could not make them out distinctly.
Once or twice I thought I could distinguish one considerably
smaller than the others, but I soon felt
that I had been mistaken. I was now in a state of
great excitement. Every limb shook like an aspen
leaf, or a cock’s tail on a windy day. What was I to
do? True, I might have fired at them, but the odds
were greatly against my being successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GUNNERS FROM BANFF.</i></div>

<p>“It was now fairly dark, and the birds had retired
to rest on a ridge of rocks which intervenes between
the sands and the links. Instead of returning
home, as any one else would have done, I laid myself
down in a hollow till morning, to wait their first
appearance, in the hope of attaining my object. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
proved a wet and windy night, but daylight brought
with it a fine morning. With it also came two
gunners from Banff, striding along the beach on a
shooting excursion. This vexed me to the very heart.
The birds were not yet astir, but I knew they would
rise at the approach of the men, who would doubtless
attempt to shoot them. Just as I anticipated, up
went the birds; crack, crack went the shots; and
down fell several birds. Rising from my stony
couch, I rushed at once to the spot to see the victims,
and found them all to consist of sanderlings, dunlins,
and one ringed plover. The gunners were strangers
to me, but I ventured to ask them to abstain from
firing until I had satisfied myself about the bird I
sought; but they seemed unable to understand why
one bird could be of more interest than another, and
they told me that, as there were plenty of them, I
could fire away, and take my chance. I declined to
shoot with them, but eagerly watched each time they
fired, and if a bird fell I went and examined it; but
I did not meet with the one I sought. The men at
last got tired, and went away.</p>

<p>“It was now my turn; but unhappily the birds,
from being so often fired at, had become extremely
shy, so that to get near them for my purpose
was all but impossible. By perseverance, however,
I at length made out one, as I thought, a good deal
smaller than the others. I succeeded in creeping a
little nearer. They rose; I fired, and down fell four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
I rushed breathless, hoping to pick up the bird in
which I took such interest. But, alas! no. It was
not there. Away went the remaining birds to the
sea; then turning, they rounded a point or headland
called Blackpots, and disappeared from view. From
this and from their not returning, I knew that they had
gone to the sands at Whitehills, about three miles distant,
to which place I proceeded. But no sooner had
I reached there, than back they flew in the direction
from which they had come. Back I went also, and
found them at the old place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHOOTS THE LITTLE STINT.</i></div>

<p>“Just as I reached them, away they flew once
more, and of course away I went likewise. In this
way we continued nearly the whole day,—they flying
to and fro, I following them. Towards evening, my
strength beginning to fail, and feeling quite exhausted,
I gave up the chase, and once more took up my
abode amongst the shingle, in the hope that they
might again return there for the night. Just as
I wished and expected, and while it was yet light,
they came and alighted about thirty yards from where
I lay. Away went fatigue, hunger, and thoughts of
home! In fact, the sight of this object of my day and
night’s solicitude made me a new creature. Off went
the messengers of death. Two of the birds fell; the
rest fled once more to the sea. I followed, but had
not proceeded far when I observed one falter. Leaving
its companions, it bent its course towards where
I stood, and suddenly dropped almost at my feet. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
I picked up the little thing, I could not but feel
thankful that my patience and perseverance had at
last been crowned with success. It was the first
Little Stint I had ever shot, and the only one I
have ever seen in this neighbourhood.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHOEMAKING WORK.</i></div>

<p>In thus pursuing his researches Edward lost much
of his time, and, in proportion to his time, he also lost
much of his wages. But his master used to assist
him in making up his lost time. It was a common
remark of his, “Give Tam the stuff for a pair of
pumps at night, and if he has any of his cantrips in
view, we are sure to have them in the morning ready
for the customer.” Edward took the stuff home with
him, and, instead of going to bed, worked at the shoes
all night, until they were finished and ready for
delivery. He had another advantage in making up
for lost time. His part of the trade was of the lightest
sort. He made light shoes and pumps. He was one
of those who, among the craft, are denominated <i>ready</i>.
He was thus able to accomplish much more than
those who were engaged at heavier work. This,
together with his practice of spending not a moment
idly, was much in his favour.</p>

<p>He also contrived to preserve his specimens during
his meal hours, or in his idle times “betwixt pairs,”—whilst,
as shoemakers would say, they were “on the
hing.” During the long winter nights, he arranged
the objects preserved, and put them in their proper
cases. In order the better to accomplish this work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he did not go to bed until a very late hour. As he
was not able to afford both fire and light, he put
out the lamp when engaged upon anything that could
be done without it, and continued his labours by the
light of the fire.</p>

<p>When forced to go to bed, he went at once, and
having slept at railway speed for an hour or an hour
and a half, he was up again and at work upon his
specimens. He felt as much refreshed, he said, by
his sound sleep, as if he had slept the whole night.
And yet, during his sleep, he must have had his mind
fixed upon his work, otherwise he could not have
wakened up at the precise time that he had previously
appointed. Besides stuffing his own birds,
he also stuffed the birds which other people had
sent him,—for which he was paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S TRAPS.</i></div>

<p>One of the objects which he had in view in making
his “rounds” so frequently, was to examine the traps
he had set, in order to catch the beetles, grubs, and
insects, which he desired to collect. His traps were
set with every imaginable organic material,—dead
birds, rats, rabbits, or hedgehogs; dead fish, crabs,
or seaweed. He placed them everywhere but on the
public roads,—in fields and woods, both on the ground
and hung on trees; in holes, in old dykes, in water, both
fresh and stagnant. Some of these traps were visited
daily, others once a week, whilst those set in water,
marshy places, and in woods, were only visited once
a month. He never passed any dead animal without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
first searching it carefully, and then removing it
to some sheltered spot. He afterwards visited it
from time to time. Fish stomachs, and the refuse of
fishermen’s lines, proved a rich mine for marine objects.
By these means he obtained many things
which could not otherwise have been obtained; and
he thus added many rare objects to his gradually
growing collection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLLECTION OF INSECTS.</i></div>

<p>He was, however, doomed to many disappointments.
One of these may be mentioned. Among
his different collections was a large variety of insects.
He had these pinned down in boxes in the usual
manner. He numbered them separately. When he
had obtained the proper names of the insects, his
intention was to prepare a catalogue. He knew that
there were sheets of figures sold for that and similar
purposes, but he could not afford to buy them. He
accordingly got a lot of old almanacs and multiplication
tables, and cut out the numbers. It was a long
and tedious process, but at length he completed it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COLLECTION DESTROYED.</i></div>

<p>When the insects were fixed and numbered,
Edward removed the cases into his garret preparatory
to glazing them. He piled them, one upon the
other, with their faces downwards, in order to keep
out the dust. There were twenty boxes, containing
in all 916 insects. After obtaining the necessary
glass, he went into the garret to fetch out the cases.
On lifting up the first case, he found that it had
been entirely stripped of its contents. He was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
horrified. He tried the others. They were all
empty! They contained nothing but the pins which
had held the insects, with here and there a head, a leg,
or a wing. A more complete work of destruction
had never been witnessed. It had probably been
perpetrated by rats or mice.</p>

<p>His wife, on seeing the empty cases, asked him
what he was to do next. “Weal,” said he, “it’s an
awfu’ disappointment, but I think the best thing
will be to set to work and fill them up again.” To
accumulate these 916 insects had cost him four years’
labour! And they had all been destroyed in a few
days, perhaps in a single night!</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Audubon had once a
similar disappointment. On leaving Henderson in
Kentucky, where he then lived, he left his drawings,
representing nearly a thousand inhabitants of the
air, in the custody of a friend. On returning a few
months later, and opening his box, he found that a
pair of Norway rats had taken possession of the whole,
and gnawed up the drawings into little bits of paper.
Audubon did what Edward now determined to do.
He went out into the woods with his gun, his notebook,
and pencils, and in the course of about three
years he again filled his portfolio.</p>

<p>Edward duly carried out his purpose. He went
moth-hunting as before; he hunted the moors and
the woods, the old buildings and the graveyards,
until, in about four more years, he had made another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
collection of insects; although there were several
specimens contained in the former collection, that he
could never again meet with.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CASES FOR THE COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>Edward had now been observing and collecting
for about eight years. His accumulations of
natural objects had therefore become considerable.
By the year 1845, he had preserved nearly 2000
specimens of living creatures found in the neighbourhood
of Banff. About half the number consisted of
quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fishes, crustacea, starfish,
zoophytes, corals, sponges, and other objects. He
had also collected an immense number of plants.
Some of the specimens were in bottles, but the greater
number were in cases with glass fronts. He could
not afford to have the cases made by a joiner; so he
made the whole of them himself, with the aid of his
shoemaker’s knife, a saw, and a hammer.</p>

<p>In order to make the smaller cases, he bought
boxes from the merchants; and in breaking them up,
he usually got as many nails as would serve to nail
the new cases together. To make the larger cases, he
bought wood from the carpenters. He papered the
insides, painted the outsides, and glazed the whole of
the cases himself. The thirty cases containing his
shells were partitioned off,—each species having a
compartment for itself. This was a difficult piece of
work, but he got through it successfully. There were
about 300 cases in all.</p>

<p>His house was now filled with stuffed birds, quadrupeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
insects, and such like objects. Every room
was packed with the cases containing them, his shoemaking
apartment included. What was he to do
with them? He had, indeed, long had a project in
his mind. In the first place, he wished to abandon
the shoemaking trade. He was desirous of raising
money for the purpose of commencing some other
business. He also wished to have some funds in
hand, in order to prosecute his investigations in
Natural History. How could he raise the requisite
money? He thought that he might raise a part of
it by exhibiting his collection. Hence his large
accumulation of specimens, and his large collection
of cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXHIBITS THE COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>There was a feeing fair held twice a year at Banff,
on market days,—called Brandon Fair. Young lads
and lasses came in from the country to be feed, and
farmers and their wives came in to fee them. It was
a great day for Banff. All the shows and wild beasts,
the dwarfs and giants, the spotted ladies and pig-faced
women, accompanied by drums and trumpets, converged
upon Banff on that day. The town, ordinarily
so quiet, became filled with people—partly to hire
and be hired, and partly to see what was to be seen.
The principal streets were kept in a continual row
until the fair was over.</p>

<p>Edward gave an exhibition of his collection at
the Brandon Fair in May 1845. He took a room in
the Trades’ Hall, and invited the public to inspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his “Collection of preserved Animals, comprising
Quadrupeds, Birds, Fishes, Insects, Shells, Eggs, and
other curiosities.”</p>

<p>The local paper called the public attention to the
rare and beautiful objects contained in Edward’s
Collection—“the results of his own untiring efforts
and ingenuity, without aid, and under discouraging
circumstances which few would have successfully
encountered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our young friends especially should
visit the Collection: it will both amuse and instruct
them. They will learn more from seeing them in
half-an-hour, than from reading about them in half-a-year.”</p>

<p>Edward took the inhabitants by surprise. They
had never been able to understand him. His wanderings
by night had been matter of great wonderment to
them. The exhibition fully explained the reason of
his frequent disappearances. When his public announcement
was advertised, some of the better classes
called at his house in Wright’s Close, to ascertain if
it was true. True, indeed! He pointed to the cases
of stuffed birds and animals which nearly filled his
house. Then the question came—“What made you
a Naturalist?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NATURALISTS NOT “MADE.”</i></div>

<p>“When I was first asked this question,” says he,
“I was completely dumfoundered! I had no notion
that a Naturalist could be <i>made</i>. What! make a
Naturalist as you would make a tradesman! I could
not believe that people became Naturalists for pecuniary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
motives. My answer to those who put the
question invariably was, and still is, <i>I cannot tell</i>. I
never knew of any external circumstance that had
anything to do with engendering, in my mind, the
never-ceasing love which I entertained for the universal
works of the Almighty; so that the real cause
must be looked for elsewhere.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOSS OF DRIED PLANTS.</i></div>

<p>In preparing for the exhibition of his Collection,
Edward brushed up his specimens, and cleaned his
cases, before removing them to the Trades’ Hall. But
in looking over his Collection, he found that he had
sustained another serious loss. He regarded it
at the time as a heartrending catastrophe. Some
time before, he had put nearly 2000 dried and preserved
plants into a box, which he had placed at the
top of the stair, in order to be out of harm’s way.
The plants were all dried and preserved. They were
the result of eight years’ labour employed in collecting
them. But when he went to overhaul the
box, he found that the lid had been shoved to one
side, and that numerous cats had entered it and made
it their lair. The plants were completely soaked,
and rendered utterly worthless. The box smelt so
abominably, that he was under the necessity of
making a bonfire of it in the back-yard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXHIBITS THE COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>All this was exceedingly disheartening. Nevertheless
he removed his remaining collection to the
place appointed for exhibiting it. He had no allurements,—no
music,—no drums nor trumpets, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
other show-people had. His exhibition was held
in an upper room, so that the sight-seers had to
mount a long stair before they could see the Collection.
Nevertheless, many persons went to see it;
and the result was, that Edward not only paid his
expenses, but had something laid by for future purposes.</p>

<p>He went on collecting for another exhibition, and
increased his specimens. He replaced, to a certain
extent, the plants which had been destroyed by the
recklessness of the cats. He obtained some wonderful
fishes and sea-birds. His collection of eggs was
greatly increased. He now prepared for a second
exhibition at the Brandon Fair, 1846. On that occasion
he was able to exhibit many old coins and
ancient relics.</p>

<p>This exhibition was more attractive and more successful
than the first. It yielded a better remuneration;
but, what was more satisfactory, Edward was
much complimented by those who had inspected his
Collection. It excited general applause. In short, it
was considered by Edward himself to be so successful
as to induce him to remove the Collection to Aberdeen,
for exhibition in that important city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small><i>EXHIBITS HIS COLLECTION IN ABERDEEN.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Banff</span> was a comparatively small and remote town;
whereas Aberdeen was the centre of northern intellect
and business. At Banff, comparatively few persons
knew much about natural history or science; whilst
Aberdeen had two universities, provided with professors,
students, and all the accompaniments of learning.
It also contained a large and intelligent population of
educated business men, tradesmen, and artizans.</p>

<p>Edward was sanguine of success at Aberdeen. It
was his City of Expectations. He was now doubly
desirous of giving up shoemaking, and devoting himself
to Natural History. For this purpose, he wanted
means and a settled income. He intended to devote
the proceeds of his exhibition in several ways. He
had, indeed, almost settled them in his own mind. He
would, in the first place, make arrangements for opening
a coffee-house or provision shop for the employment
and support of his family. He would next
purchase some works on Natural History by the best
authors. He would probably also buy a microscope
and some other necessary scientific instruments.
Alnaschar, in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, with the basket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
glass at his feet, did not dream more of what he
would do with his forthcoming income, than Edward
did of what he would do with the successful results
of his exhibition at Aberdeen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DRAMATIC BIRD-STUFFING.</i></div>

<p>But Edward must now be up and doing. The
cases had to be put in order; new objects had to be
added to the collection; new birds had to be stuffed.
Some of the groups had to be arranged in dramatic
form. One of these consisted of the Death of Cock
Robin. There was the Sparrow perched upon a twig,
warrior-like, with his bow in one of his feet, and his
arrow-case slung across his back. There was the red-breasted
Robin lying on a green and mossy knoll,
with the arrow shot by the sparrow sticking in his
little heart; and in a burn meandering close by, there
was a silvery fish with its little dish, catching
Robin’s life-blood. There was also a great black
beetle, with a thread and needle, ready to sew his
shroud.</p>

<p>In another case, the Babes in the Wood were represented,—two
Robin Redbreasts covering their tender
bodies with leaves. There was a case of mice,
entitled “Pussy from Home:” the mice, large and
small, were going into and coming out of a meal-bag,
which they were rifling. There was another large
case, containing a number of small birds in a state
of great excitement, darting and pecking at an object
in the middle of the case, which proved to be a Weasel,
attempting to rob a yellow Bunting’s nest, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
six eggs, one of which the weasel had rolled out.
Perhaps the best case was the one containing a
Pheasant, with six young birds,—all beautifully
stuffed. For this Edward was offered three guineas
before he left Banff.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLLECTION TAKEN TO ABERDEEN.</i></div>

<p>At length all was ready, and Edward, with a light
heart, left Banff for Aberdeen. The collection was
taken in six carriers’ carts,—the largest that could be
found. Edward could not take it by railway, for
there were no railways then in Banff. The whole
family accompanied the collection. It consisted of
Edward, his wife, and five children. They set out
early in the morning of Friday, the 31st of July 1846,—a
memorable day in Edward’s history. The six
cartloads arrived safe at Aberdeen on the evening
of the following day.</p>

<p>Edward had previously taken the shop No. 132,
Union Street, for the purposes of his exhibition. This
street is the finest in Aberdeen—perhaps the finest in
Scotland. It is wide and broad, and about a mile
long. The houses are of hewn granite; some of
them of massive and noble architecture. Union Street
is the representative street of the Grey City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ADVERTISEMENT.</i></div>

<p>Handbills were issued, and advertisements published
in the local journals, announcing the opening
of the exhibition. In the handbill it was stated that
“the objects comprising this collection have been
collected in the counties of Banff and Aberdeen, and
preserved by a single individual, and that individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a journeyman shoemaker. They have been exhibited
by him in Banff, to the delight and admiration of
every visitor—all being surprised at the beauty, order,
and multitude of the various objects,—some going so
far as to doubt the fact of the proprietor being a shoemaker,
saying that it was impossible for a person of
that trade being able to do anything like what they
saw before them!”</p>

<p>“Thomas Edward takes the liberty of stating that
the Collection is allowed by eminent Naturalists to
be one of the greatest curiosities ever offered for public
inspection in this quarter, amounting, as it does,
to above two thousand objects; and being the work
of one individual, who had to labour under every disadvantage,
having none to tell how or where to find
the different objects, none to teach him how to preserve
these objects when found, no sound of promised
reward ringing in his ears to urge him on his singular
course, no friend to accompany him in his nightly
wanderings; help from none; but solely dependent
on his own humble abilities and limited resources.</p>

<p>“Were it possible for words to describe, in adequate
terms, the unexampled assiduity and unwearied
perseverance with which Thomas Edward has laboured
in the formation of his Collection, it would surprise
every individual capable of reflection. Such not being
the case, a visit to the Exhibition can alone enable
the public to form any idea of the extent of his
labours. The ocean, the rocky shore, the shingly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sandy beach, the meadows, the cultivated fields, the
whinny knowes, the woods; the running brooks, the
stagnant pools, the muddy and unsavoury ditches,
the marshy flats; old walls, ruined towers, and heath-clad
hills, have all been visited and anxiously searched
in order to procure the objects which compose the
Collection.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TERMS OF ADMISSION.</i></div>

<p>Such was Edward’s appeal to the people of Aberdeen
to come and see his Collection. The terms were
very moderate,—“Ladies and Gentlemen, 6d; Tradespeople,
3d.; Children, half-price.” The <i>Aberdeen
Journal</i> thus noticed the Collection—“We have been
particularly struck with the very natural attitudes in
which the beasts and birds of prey are placed; some
being represented as tearing their victims, others feeding
their young, and some looking sideward or backward,
with an expression of the eye which indicates
the fear of interruption. The birds are very beautiful,
and the entomological specimens will be found exceedingly
interesting.”</p>

<p>On the Thursday following his arrival in Aberdeen,
Edward opened his collection. He was in hopes
that there would be a rush to see the objects which
he had collected with so much difficulty during the
last eight years. He believed in himself, though
others did not yet believe in him. But there was no
rush—no eager multitude crowding the door of No.
132. Indeed, very few persons called to see the Collection.
These might, however, tell their friends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
its interest, and the rush might still come. But he
waited in vain. The rush never came.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VISITORS OF THE COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>The principal people who called upon him during
the first ten days were stuffed-bird sellers, and persons
who pestered him to buy nearly everything of a
bestial kind, alive or dead. Some of the articles
offered were monstrosities or delusions, such as double
chickens, double mice, a kitten with a rat’s head, a
double-headed dog, a rat with two tails, both curled up
like a pig’s,—and such like objects. These people
were all bowed to the door.</p>

<p>Several ladies called upon Edward to consult him
about their favourite pets. One had a lapdog that
was sick; another a bird that was lame; others had
crippled or diseased cats. He was asked to come
and see a pig that had broken one of its legs. A
gentleman called upon him one day about an old
and favourite rabbit whose front teeth had grown so
forward that it could not eat,—“Would he come and
cut them off?” “No! he had not time. He must
attend to his exhibition.”</p>

<p>Very few people came. Those who did come,
knew very little about natural history. Their
ignorance of the works of nature seemed to Edward
surprising. Only a few knew anything, excepting
about the commoner sorts of animals. As to the
number, and nature, and habits of living creatures,
they appeared to know next to nothing. The transformation
of insects was a mystery to them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
could not see how it was possible for an ugly caterpillar
to become transformed into a beautiful butterfly.
Edward felt very much for the ignorance of men of
his own class: it was simply deplorable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROFESSIONAL VISITORS.</i></div>

<p>Dr. Macgillivray, Professor of Natural History in
Marischal College, Aberdeen, called upon Edward,
and was much pleased with his collection of Banffshire
fauna. The professor told him that the inhabitants
of Aberdeen were not yet prepared for an
exhibition of this kind. There was not even a public
museum in the city; no collection of natural objects;
no free library; nothing for the enlightenment of the
higher and nobler faculties of man! To this cause
Edward, in a great measure, attributed the failure of
his exhibition. Some of the professors who afterwards
called to see the collection, told Edward that
“the people of Aberdeen were not yet prepared for
such an exhibition, especially as it had been the work
of a poor man. He had come several centuries too
soon.”</p>

<p>Several of the persons who examined the exhibition,
did not believe that it had been the work of
Edward at all. Among his better-class visitors was
a gentleman who frequently came in as he passed,
and carefully examined the specimens. He sometimes
gave Edward half-a-crown, and would not take any
change back. The gentleman was an inveterate and
persistent interrogator. His questions were usually
of a personal character. But Edward had by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
time prepared a <i>bag of forgetfulness</i>, into which he
put all the disagreeable things that were said to him;
and once there, he remembered them no more. Edward
believed that his visitor belonged to the medical
profession, and that he was connected with a neighbouring
dispensary.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A SEVERE INTERROGATOR.</i></div>

<p>One day the visitor arrived, and without looking
at the specimens, he went directly up to Edward and
asked, “Well, how are you getting on?” “Very
poorly,” was the answer. “And no wonder!” said
the visitor. “How?” “How!” he almost shouted,
“because the people here don’t believe in such a
thing. I am sure of it from what I know and have
heard myself.”</p>

<p>“But if they would only come!”</p>

<p>“Come? that’s the very thing. It seems they’ll
not come. And although they did, what satisfactory
evidence is there that what they see is the result of
your own unaided and individual labour? You are
quite a stranger here. You should have had some
persons of high standing in the city to take you
under their patronage: say the professors of both
colleges, or the provost and town-council. Oh! you
needn’t shake your head and look at the floor. It
would have been much better.”</p>

<p>“I never considered myself in a position,” said
Edward, “to ask such a favour.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>“Then you’ll not succeed here unless you do something
of the sort.”</p>

<p>“In that case, then,” said Edward, “I’ll be plain
enough to tell you that I never will succeed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD DISBELIEVED.</i></div>

<p>“You are too stiff—too unbending,” said the
Doctor. “Then, you know very well, that you have
nobody in Aberdeen to confirm your extraordinary
statement. You say that the whole of this collection
is entirely the work of your own hands, and that it
is your own exclusive property!”</p>

<p>“Yes! I bought the game birds; and as regards
the others, I procured the whole of them myself,—preserved
them and cased them, just as you see them.”</p>

<p>“And had you to work for your living all that
time?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and for the living of my family too.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a wife and a family?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have five children.”</p>

<p>“The devil!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I said children.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I know; I beg your pardon. But do you
mean to say that you have maintained your wife and
family by working at your trade, all the while that
you have been making this collection?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! How is it possible that you
could have done that?”</p>

<p>“By never losing a single minute, nor any part of
a minute, that I could by any means improve.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of any one else who had ever
done the like before?”</p>

<p>“No. But thousands might have done it, and much
more too.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe it. I have never heard of
such a thing, and I have never read of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“But I never thought,” said Edward, “that I was
doing anything, that any one else might not have
done. I was quite unaware of the fact that I was
doing anything in the least way meritorious. But
if I have, as a journeyman shoemaker, done anything
worthy of praise, then I must say that there is not a
working man on the face of the earth that could not
have done much more than I have done; for of all the
occupations that are known, that of shoemaking is
surely the very worst.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE THING “IMPOSSIBLE.”</i></div>

<p>“Had you been an outside-worker, I would not
have thought so much about it; but even then it
would have been surprising. But having to work
from morning to night in a shoemaker’s shop—where
these things can neither be seen nor found—the thing
is perfectly inconceivable. I’ll give my oath that, so
far as Aberdeen is concerned, or I believe any other
place, there is not a single working-man who could,
by himself, have done anything of the sort. I tell
you, that there is no person who knows the labouring
people and their circumstances, better than I do;
and I tell you again, that, situated as they are, the
thing is quite impossible. They have neither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
learning nor the opportunities necessary for scientific
pursuits; nor yet the time nor the money to spare
for the purpose. No, poor devils! they need all
their time and all their money to eke out their bare
and half-starved existence.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you,” replied Edward, “in
some of your remarks; but I am sorry to say that the
wretchedness you allude to, is in too many cases attributable
to themselves, and also to their slatternly
and improvident wives. They do not go into the
fields to drink in the sweets of nature, but rush
unthinkingly into the portals of hell, and drown
their sorrows in whisky. In this way they beggar
themselves and pauperise their families.”</p>

<p>“There is doubtless something in that,” said the
doctor, “but I spoke in general. Of course, there
are exceptions. It would appear that you are one,
and a most extraordinary one too. And here it is
that I am most puzzled. I can’t understand how
you have done all this single-handed. Besides, you
must have read a great deal. You must have had
access to the best scientific works; and you must
also have possessed sufficient means to enable you
to collect and arrange these things as they now are.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S VINDICATION.</i></div>

<p>“Permit me to say, sir,” said Edward, “that I am
not a book-learner, nor have I ever read any scientific
works. I never had any access to them. Nor do I
possess any means besides those that I have earned
by hard and constant work.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“What! have you had no education? no access
to scientific works?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, how the deuce did you manage?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I have told you that several times
before. But I’ll tell you again,—this time in a few
words. My chief school was the Earth, and my
principal teacher was Nature. What I have been
able to do, has been done by economising every
farthing of money, and every moment of time.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you got no education,
and had no money but what you worked for?”</p>

<p>“I do, and”——</p>

<p>“Confounded nonsense!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S REAL TEACHERS.</i></div>

<p>“Allow me to proceed! It is not always those
who have the most money and the best education,
that do the most work, either in natural history
or anything else.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! That’s all very well; but it’s not to
the point. But (looking at his watch) I find I must
go. I’ll call again; for I am determined to be at the
bottom of this affair.”</p>

<p>The next time he called, Edward was standing at
the door. “Well,” said he, “I can’t wait to-day, for I
have to go into the country, and I can’t be home for
a week. But here’s your fare.” “No, no,” said
Edward; “you haven’t been in.” “Very well, here
goes!” and he pitched the fare in amongst the birds.
When Edward went to look at the fare, instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
penny, he found a crown-piece. The gentleman
never called again. By the time he returned from
the country, the exhibition was at an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INVITES HIS MILL-MATES.</i></div>

<p>As Edward had announced in his handbill that
he had been an inhabitant of Aberdeen, and worked
at the Grandholm Mills in his boyhood, some of his
old companions called upon him at the Exhibition.
The paragraph in the handbill was as follows:—“The
idea of having a collection of the Works of Nature
was first formed by him (the Exhibitor) in very early
life, and whilst traversing the country in the vicinity
of Aberdeen, but more particularly when wandering
amongst the delightful haughs of Grandholm, where
he went to work when little more than nine years
of age. Should this come under the notice of any of
those who were mill-mates with Thomas Edward,
they perchance may remember the boy they all
wondered at so much, because he would not join
in their youthful sports, but rather chose to wander
alone through the woods or by the banks of the Don,
in quest of those objects, the pursuit of which in after
years cost him so much labour, time, and expense.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS SHOPMATES UNPERSUADED.</i></div>

<p>As nearly twenty years had passed since Edward
had worked at the spinning-mills, he failed to recognise
his early companions when they called, until
they mentioned some circumstance or conversation
which brought them to his recollection. Some
walked round the collection before they made themselves
known to him, whilst others did so as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
entered. But one and all agreed, that though they
might have imagined that Edward had done something
towards making the collection, they could not
believe that he had done it all by himself, whilst
working at his trade. They were working men themselves,
and knew what they had to contend with, in
the form of want of time, want of means, and difficulties
of all sorts. These considerations only tended
to heighten their sense of astonishment the more.</p>

<p>Some of Edward’s other acquaintances also called,
and they, like the others, declared that it was perfectly
impossible for any working-man to have made such
a collection by himself without any extraneous aid.
One of his old shopmates called frequently, and
Edward endeavoured to convince him that the thing
was quite feasible; but he insisted that he must
have got assistance or help in some way or another.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Edward, “you remember how I
worked beside you in the old garret in Shoe Lane,
how I was never idle, and was always busy at something,
whether I had shoemaking to do or not. Very
well! I continued the same practice after I left you;
and when I got a wife, instead of growing lazier, I
became more ardent than ever. I squeezed the pith
and substance out of every moment to make the most
of it; and raxed and drew every farthing out like a
piece of india-rubber, until I could neither rax nor
draw it any more. I have thus endeavoured to
make the most and the best of everything.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VINDICATES HIS WIFE.</i></div>

<p>A new idea seemed to strike the man. “But did
ye no get some bawbees wi’ yer wife?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Edward, “not a bawbee! But, though
poor in cash, she brought me a dowry worth more
than all the money ever coined!”</p>

<p>“Trash, man, trash! Fat could be better than
siller till a puir man?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. She brought me a remarkably
sound and healthy body,—strong bones, and a casket
well filled with genuine common sense, or rather a
mind far superior to that usually possessed by the
majority of her sex. Now that’s what I call better
than money. And I can tell you also, that if young
men were to look out for such wives, they would be
able to lead their lives to much better purpose than
they now do. Your tap-rooms, and dram-shops, and
public-houses, would then have fewer and far less
eager customers. And, if I am not much mistaken,
there would be many more happy homes and happy
families, especially amongst the poor; instead of the
miserable, heart-sickening, disease-engendering hovels,
which are a curse and a stain upon our so-called
civilisation.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be a temperance man, then, are ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m temperate enough. And if wives would
look more to their husbands’ comfort, as well as to
the interests of their own families, there would
be far more temperance men, as you call them, than
there are now. I’m not a member of the Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Society; nevertheless I am in favour of everything
that would make people more sober and diligent, and
tend to man’s good, both here and hereafter.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued the man, “are ye satisfied that
ye got nae help in the way I hinted?”</p>

<p>“None whatever!”</p>

<p>“But far did ye learn the wrightin’ (carpentering),
the paintin’, and the glazin’?”</p>

<p>“At my ain fireside, where everything good should
be learnt. My teachers were,—first, ‘Necessity,’ and,
secondly, another teacher, of whom you may not have
heard, called <span class="smcap">Will</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD “A MYSTERY.”</i></div>

<p>“Ye’re a mystery,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be,” answered Edward; “but
I’ll just tell you three things, whether you may understand
the ‘mystery’ or not. My neighbours in Banff
say of me, that ‘that man surely means to tak’ the
world by speed o’ fit.’ My shopmates say, that
‘Tam is just the lad for taking time by the forelock;’
and many of the inhabitants say, ‘Whoever may be
seen lounging about at the lazy corners, you’ll never
see Edward among them.’ Now, these are three
little nuts, which I hope you will crack amongst your
shopmates; and I hope they will do them good.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A LADY VISITOR.</i></div>

<p>One day two ladies came to see the Exhibition.
They looked over the collection, and one of them
came up to Edward, and looked him straight in the
face. She asked him if he belonged to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “although I was not born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Aberdeen, still I may say I belong to it. My mother
was an Aberdeen woman, and I was brought up here,
until I went to Banff,” “Ah,” said the lady, “I
thought so. Your countenance and appearance are
very much the same as they were when I last saw
you.” “Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Were you not at one time a private in the Aberdeenshire
militia?” “I was; but what of that?”
“Allow me to explain: Do you remember running
out of the ranks one day while at drill, and flying
after a butterfly?” “I do,” said Edward.</p>

<p>“And of being pursued and taken prisoner by a
corporal and four men of your company, when you
were brought up before the officer, who gave you
your liberty?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edward, “all that is true.” “And
perhaps you remember that there was a group
of ladies with the officer?” “Oh yes, I remember
that.” “Well, then, I was one of those ladies; and
I first proposed to the others that we should intercede
with the captain to let you off.”</p>

<p>The lady then proceeded to explain that she herself
was an entomologist, and had been greatly pleased
with the collection. Edward, on his part, thanked
her most cordially for the good service she had been
able to do for him on the links that day, now so long
past. “But now,” she added, “as one good turn deserves
another, will you come and take your tea and
supper with us some evening?” Edward was thunderstruck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
at this proposal, for he was an exceedingly
shy and bashful man, though he had been such
a “hempy” in his youth. “Oh no!” said he, “I cannot
venture on taking such a liberty.” “I’ll have no
denial,” said the lady; “there will be only a few
friends who wish to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REFUSES TO BE A “LION.”</i></div>

<p>The idea of being exhibited as a Lion was perfectly
revolting to Edward; so he again protested that he
could not accept the invitation, however kindly it
was meant. “No, no; you <i>must</i> come. There’s my
card and address, and when I have fixed the day, I’ll
send you an invitation. Good-day. Now remember!
one good turn deserves another!” And away she
went, leaving Edward looking rather sheepish, and
fumbling in his hand a piece of elegantly-got-up and
highly aromatic pasteboard.</p>

<p>When the servant came with the invitation two
days later, Edward returned a message that it was
impossible for him to accept the invitation, because
he could not leave his collection. The servant again
returned, and invited him to attend the party after
the exhibition had been closed for the night. He
again politely refused.</p>

<p>The lady never returned to the exhibition; and
Edward felt that he had grievously offended her by
refusing her invitation. Yet, had she known of his
position at the time, her heart would have melted
with pity at his sufferings. But this was of too
touching and too delicate a nature to be explained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
her. By that time, although Edward’s doom was not
altogether sealed, still he knew, humanly speaking,
that his fate was inevitably fixed, and that he had no
visible means of escape from his lamentable position.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>APPEALS TO “THE MILLIONS.”</i></div>

<p>We have said that when Edward opened his exhibition
in Aberdeen, he expected that there would be
a large influx of visitors to see the collection of
objects in natural history, which he had made with
so much labour and difficulty. But there was no
rush whatever. The attendance was always very
small. The exhibition-room was for the most part
empty. Edward at first thought that he had fixed the
price too high. But he could remedy that defect. The
better classes had failed him; now he would try the
working-people. He would call “the millions” to
his aid. Accordingly he reduced the entrance-price
to a penny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EXHIBITION A FAILURE.</i></div>

<p>But “the millions” never came. So far as
Edward’s collection was concerned, their minds
seemed as hard and impenetrable as the adamantine
houses in which they lived. Their hearts, he
thought, were made of their native granite. Still
he would make another effort. He now advertised
more widely than before, thinking that extended
publicity might prove successful. He had bills
printed by the thousand; he employed sandwich-men
to carry them about, to distribute them in the
market, in the principal thoroughfares, at the gates
of the factories and principal working places, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in every place resorted to by working people. To
accommodate them, he opened the exhibition at eight
instead of ten in the morning; and kept it open until
ten o’clock at night.</p>

<p>It was of no avail. The millions did not come.
The attendance even fell off. Some days only a few
pence were taken; on other days nothing. Days,
weary days, went on, and still there was no success.
Yet Edward had plenty of advisers. Some thought
that the collection should have been exhibited near
the centre of the town, where the working classes
lived. Edward was fain to think that there might
be something in this. He found a large room which
he thought would answer the purpose; but he was
required to pay the rent beforehand, and to give
security for ten pounds. This was entirely out of
the question, for he could not give security for “ten
bawbees.” One person, who had been a showman,
advised him to have immense placards outside, and
to have a band of music to attract the people. He
must have show and hubbub. “That was the thing
that attracted folk; whereas his exhibition was all
in the inside.” But Edward would not have any of
such attractions.</p>

<p>In short, the exhibition was fast approaching its
end. The rent of the shop had to be paid, and he had
no money to pay it. His wife and family had to
be maintained, and he had no means of maintaining
them. All that he took at the door, was required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
pay the cost of the bills and advertisements. By the
end of the third week, he was deep in debt. Though
he had been earning small wages, he had never before
been in debt. To think of being in debt was in
itself an agony. What was he to do? He was sinking
deeper and deeper, with no prospect of deliverance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD IN DESPAIR.</i></div>

<p>By the Friday of the fourth week, he had altogether
lost hope. He had taken nothing in the shape
of money that day. His exhibition was entirely
deserted. He sank into the lowest state of despondency.
About three o’clock he received a letter from
his master at Banff, telling him that if he did not
return immediately to his work, he would be under
the necessity of giving his employment to another.
“Return immediately?” That was impossible. What
was he to do with his collection? How was he to
defray his debt?</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at, if, under these
deplorable circumstances, despair—despair of the
worst description—should have got the better, at least
for a time, of his over-taxed and over-sensitive brain.
He was in a strange place,—a place which had once
known him, but knew him no more. His wife and
his five children were altogether dependent upon him,
though they were at present living with his aged
and infirm parents. He was deep in debt, for which,
if not liquidated, his collection would be seized,—a
collection, rather than part with which, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sacrificed his life. At the same time, the loss of work,
starvation, and ruin, stared him in the face. Is it
surprising that, thus situated, despair should for a
time have got the mastery over his better and sounder
judgment?</p>

<p>The afternoon was far advanced. His dinner, which
had been brought to him an hour before, still lay untasted.
He was pacing up and down the apartment,
pondering over his miserable position, when his father
entered. Edward was looking so agitated, that the
old man inquired “what ailed him?” He said he was
going out, and went towards the door, fearing lest his
wife or any of his children might appear. His father
stepped between him and the door, remonstrating with
him, and saying that he was not fit to go out in such
a state. But a woman entering, attracted his father’s
attention, and Edward was thus allowed to slip away
unobserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RUNS TO THE SEA-SHORE.</i></div>

<p>Edward rushed down Union Street, on his way
to the sands. At first he thought of going to the Dee
at the Craiglug; but he bethought him that it would
be better to go to the sea-shore, where it might be
thought his death was accidental. From the time of
his leaving the shop in Union Street until about four
hours after, when he recovered his senses, his memory
remained almost a complete blank. He had a vague
idea of crossing the links, and seeing some soldiers at
the foot of the Broadhill. But beyond that, he remembered
next to nothing. Unlike a dream, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
one remembers some confused ideas, this blank in his
mental life was never filled up, and the purpose for
which he wandered along the sands left little further
impression upon his memory. He remembered, however,
the following circumstances:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FLOCK OF SANDERLINGS.</i></div>

<p>He had thrown off his hat, coat, and waistcoat,
before rushing into the sea; when a flock of sanderlings
lit upon the sands near him. They attracted
his attention. They were running to and fro, some
piping their low shrill whistle, whilst others were
probing the wet sand with their bills as the waves
receded. But amongst them was another bird, larger
and darker, and apparently of different habits to the
others. Desirous of knowing something of the nature
of this bird, he approached the sanderlings. They
rose and flew away. He followed them. They lit
again, and again he observed the birds as before.
Away they went, and he after them. At length
he was stopped at Don mouth. When he recovered
his consciousness, he was watching the flock of birds
flying away to the farther side of the river. He had
forgotten all his miseries in his intense love of nature.
His ruling passion saved him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PROVIDENTIAL BIRD.</i></div>

<p>How long the chase lasted he never could tell.
It must have occupied him more than an hour. He
found himself divested of his hat, coat, and vest;
and he went back to look for them. He had no
further desire to carry out the purpose for which he
had descended to the sea. His only thought was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
about the strange bird among the sanderlings: “What
could it be?” Perhaps the bird had been his Providence.
He tried to think so.</p>

<p>In the meantime, he was very cold. He found
his coat, vest, and hat, a long way down the beach. On
his return, he found that he had been followed by
some people, who were watching him. When he returned,
they followed him until he reached his clothes.
And when they saw him dressed, and ready to depart,
they disappeared. Not wishing to cross the links
again that night, he turned and went up Don side
to the new bridge, and took the road from thence into
the town.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image165.jpg" width="600" height="362" alt="shore" />
<div class="caption">THE MOUTH OF THE DON.</div>
</div>

<p>It was late before he got home. Being still very
much depressed, and feeling very unwell, he went
almost immediately to bed, thinking that he might
be able to hide his grief yet a little longer from
those who were near and dear to him,—dearer to
him now than ever. But, alas! the ordeal he had
passed through during the day, had been most dreadful;
and he was racked by conflicting and torturing
thoughts during the whole of his sleepless night.</p>

<p>Morning, anxiously-wished-for morning, came at
last. Although still feverish from excitement, and
very unsettled in his mind, he got up, dressed, and
went down to the sea-shore a little after daylight,
eagerly searching for the strange bird of the preceding
evening. But although he walked several times along
the sands, from the bathing machines to the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the Don, he never saw it. He saw its companions,
the sanderlings; but the providential bird had gone.
So far as Edward knew, he never saw the like of that
bird again.</p>

<p>Although chagrined at his disappointment, he felt
himself, on the whole, more refreshed and settled
in his mind than when he left home. After breakfast—the
first food he had taken since the previous
morning—he went to Union Street to open his exhibition.
As he was not disturbed by visitors, he
had plenty of time for reflection. He had now to
consider how he could honourably extricate himself
from the trap into which he had so unwittingly and
so unfortunately fallen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COLLECTION ADVERTISED.</i></div>

<p>The only way which presented itself was by
making a terrible sacrifice,—namely, by selling the
whole of his collection. It took him many long and
bitter heart-pangs before he could arrive at this conclusion.
But force, stern force, prevailed over all
other considerations. He must, so far as he could,
get honourably out of debt, although not a farthing of
balance might remain. Yes! his eight years’ collection
of birds and natural objects must go, so that he
might stand upright before the world. Accordingly,
an advertisement appeared in the newspapers offering
the collection for sale.</p>

<p>After the announcement appeared, several gentlemen
called and told him that he was quite wrong
in offering his collection for sale. He had several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
letters from Banff, to the same effect. Some of his
correspondents there offered their suggestions and
advice. They said that as the collection had been
made in Banffshire, it properly belonged to Banffshire;
and that it would be an everlasting slur upon the
county if it were allowed to go elsewhere. One gentleman
of influence requested Edward to delay the sale
for a few days, in order that he might be enabled to
obtain subscriptions, so as to secure the collection for
Banff. Twenty pounds could easily be collected in
Banff for such a purpose. If the subscribers did not
themselves buy it, there was a Scientific Society in
Banff that would certainly buy it, to form the nucleus
of a collection of Banffshire fauna.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COLLECTION SOLD.</i></div>

<p>Edward accordingly postponed the sale for some
days. He had great faith in his correspondent, who
was himself a member of the society in question. The
gentleman had considerable influence in the district,
and would doubtless do what he could to raise the
requisite money to purchase the collection. But, alas!
how futile are promises. Words! mere words! Days
passed, and no further communications arrived. Edward
was now pressed for his debts, and he could no
longer postpone the sale of the collection. The spark
of hope that had been kindled in his breast, died out.
All hope of salvation from any quarter had fled. He
must meet his difficulties as he best could. It was
now the middle of the sixth week, and his expenses
were increasing daily. Accordingly, he accepted the
offer of £20:10s. for the whole of his collection!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COLLECTION DESTROYED.</i></div>

<p>It was a bitter pang to part with it; but the thing
must be done. Howling was of no use. Edward was
even glad to get that paltry sum, in order to be at last
set free. The gentleman (Mr. Grant) who bought the
collection, wished it for his boy, who had a taste for
natural history. The specimens were removed to his
house at Ferryhill. They were afterwards packed up
and sent to his place in St. Nicholas Street, where
they were stored up in some damp and unsuitable
room; and, being otherwise neglected, it is believed
that the whole collection eventually went to ruin.</p>

<p>Perhaps Edward might have got more money for
his collection if he had broken it up, and offered it in
lots. Professor Dickie was willing to buy a number
of his specimens, and to pay a good price for them;
but this would have involved a considerable loss of
time, and also a considerable increase of expense.
He was therefore under the necessity of disposing of
the whole at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S APOLOGY.</i></div>

<p>“Whatever,” says Edward, “may have been the
real cause of my ruin and want of success, I must say
that, although I was not supported and encouraged, I
had no real claim upon the inhabitants of Aberdeen.
I certainly do owe many of them—particularly those
of the upper and middle classes of society—a deep
debt of gratitude for their courteous attention and
their offered hospitality. Although circumstances
did not allow me to avail myself of their kindness, I
have never forgotten the unfeigned favours which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they proffered me. I know that some of them were
deeply offended at my refusing their invitations; but,
had they known of my deplorable position at the
time, I feel certain that their feeling of offence would
have given place to the deeper and softer feeling of
pity for the unfortunate.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small><i>RESUMES HIS FORMER HABITS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> had left Banff on the 31st of July 1846, full
of hope; after six weeks he returned to it, full
of despair. He had gone to Aberdeen with his collection,
accompanied by his wife and family; he returned
from it alone and on foot, without a single
specimen of his collection, and without a penny in his
pocket that he could call his own. He felt ruined,
disappointed, beggared,—his aims and hopes in life
blasted. He was under the necessity of leaving his
wife and children at Aberdeen; for they could not travel
fifty miles to Banff on foot.</p>

<p>Edward felt terribly crushed on re-entering his
desolate home. A strange-like heaviness of mind
came over him. The place was drear and lonesome.
It was so different from what it had once been. It
was no longer enlivened by the prattle of his children,
or the pleasant looks of his wife. There was neither
fire, nor food, nor money. The walls, which, only
a few weeks before, had been covered with his treasures—the
results of the hard labour of years—were
bare and destitute. The house was desolation itself.</p>

<p>After remaining there for a short time, a neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
came in, and asked Edward to come to his house
and get some food. He most gladly assented to the
proposal. He afterwards went to see his master, and
arranged with him as to the re-commencement of his
work. This was easily accomplished, as Edward was
considered a Don at his trade.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> After this had been
settled, he went to pay a short visit to a friend at
Gardenstown, until his wife and family had returned
from Aberdeen. Edward could not bear to remain
in his house until they had come back. Nor could
he yet pay for their journey. But the carrier, who
had taken the collection and the family to Aberdeen,
cheerfully consented to bring the latter back free.</p>

<p>It was during this interval that Edward lived for
a few days with his friend, Mr. Gordon of Gardenstown.
The place had long been one of Edward’s favourite
haunts. He was able, in a sort of way, to enjoy
the coast scenery, to see the busy fishermen going out
to sea in the evenings, and to listen to the noisy
clamour of the sea-fowl at Gamrie Mohr.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD RETURNS HOME.</i></div>

<p>When Edward knew that his wife and family had
reached Banff, he returned home, and was joyfully met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
by his wife and bairns. Home had already begun
to look more homely. There was a fire to sit down
beside, and a family circle to converse with. Care,
despondency, and despair, had already to a certain
extent been cast aside. There would yet be peace
and plenty about the fireside. Edward threw off
the showman’s garb, and donned that of the hard-working
sutor.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Next morning he was busy at his
trade, sewing, hammering, and “skelping away at the
leather.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEGINS AGAIN.</i></div>

<p>During the ensuing autumn and winter, he passed
his time at his ordinary daily work. He refrained
from going out at night. He had parted with all his
objects in Natural History, and he did nothing as
yet to replace them. But his mind had been at
work all the while. As spring advanced, he found
it impossible to check his ruling passion. His day’s
work done, he again started with his gun on his
shoulder, his insect boxes and appendages slung
round his back, his plant case by his side, and a host
of pill boxes, small bottles, and such like, packed
in his pockets. Away he went, with heart as light
as a feather, to search, as long as light remained, for
tenants of the woods, the fields, and the sea-shore.</p>

<p>When daylight faded into darkness, he would
sit down as usual for a nap—it did not matter where,—by
the side of a rock, on a sand-bank, in a hole in
the ground, in a dry ditch, under the cover of a bush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
behind a dyke, in a ruined castle, or by the side of
a tree: it was all the same to him. There he lay
until the first peep of morning appeared, when he
started up, and was at work again. He continued, until
he thought he had just sufficient time left to get
to his workshop by the appointed hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS ZEAL REDOUBLED.</i></div>

<p>His zeal was more than renewed. It was redoubled.
He proceeded with even greater perseverance
than before. His few friends warned him in vain.
They thought he might spend his energies to some
better purpose. If their advice staggered him, it
was only for an instant. “One look,” he says, “at
my cobbler’s stool, dispelled every consideration. My
wish was, at some time or other, to wrench myself
free from my trade.”</p>

<p>He adopted the self-same plan that he had formerly
employed. As soon as his day’s work was over,
he started on his nightly expedition. During five
months of the year he slept out,—excepting on
Saturday and Sunday nights, or when the weather
was stormy. To his former equipment he added
a small trowel for digging up plants and grubs, and a
hammer for splitting fossils or chipping off parts of
any rock that he might wish to preserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS PARAPHERNALIA.</i></div>

<p>At first he used chip-boxes, to carry the insects
which he collected during his tours; but he found
them such a worry that he was obliged to use something
else. He once bought so many chip-boxes from
a druggist, that he refused to sell him any more until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his stock was replenished. Edward carried in them
slugs, caterpillars, snails, worms, spiders, shells, various
sorts of insects, eggs of small birds, and every
other little nick-nack that he wished to preserve.
Here is his description of his hunting paraphernalia:—</p>

<p>“My coat had eight pockets, four outside and four
inside. The two lower inside ones were ‘meal-pocks’
for size. My waistcoat, too, had four rather big receptacles:
the term ‘waistcoat pockets’ could scarcely
describe them. Besides these, I had a number of bags
or wallets, hung over my shoulders, or tied round my
middle, or under my coat, according to their intended
uses. I had also several queer-looking things which
I carried in my hands and called ‘accessories;’ for
there is no other specific name for the articles.
Nevertheless, all had their quota of chip-boxes, except
my butterfly and moth-case, and my plant book.
These were generally kept sacred for their respective
purposes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXCURSION TO BALLOCH.</i></div>

<p>On one occasion Edward went out for a three
days’ ramble among the Balloch hills, between Keith
and Huntly, about twenty miles south-west of Banff.
The object of his journey was to collect butterflies,
moths, and various objects. He had not his gun with
him, but he had many more chip-boxes than usual.
A friend of his had often urged him to bring him a lot
of ants for some birds, and Edward determined to
satisfy him. He had been very successful in his
search, and had also filled many boxes for his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day, while he was
busily engaged on a wild, wide, and desolate moor,
he was startled by a sudden flash of lightning. Had
he been attending to the weather instead of to his own
pursuits, he might have seen the brooding clouds
wending their way towards him from the south. He
might then have found some convenient shelter from
the impending storm. But after the first flash of lightning,
it broke upon him almost at once. He had
scarcely got his things put in order, and the ant-boxes
deposited in his coat pocket, when down
came the deluge! None but those who have been
under the influence of hill-rains, can have any idea of
their tremendous force. It is like the downpour of a
cataract. The rain falls in sheets, in waves, almost
solid. Nothing but the stiffest weather-proof can
keep the water out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FURIOUS STORM.</i></div>

<p>Edward’s first thought was shelter! But where
could he find it? Not a house was to be seen; not a
wall, not a tree, not a bush. He could not find
even a hole in a sandbank. There was nothing that
he could see around him but a dreary, bleak, widespread
moor. Nevertheless he set off, running as
fast as he could, in the hope of at length reaching
some friendly haven. After having run a long time
amidst thunder and lightning, through water, moss,
and heather, he stopped for a moment to consider
where he was running. There was still no sign of a
house, or hut, or shealing. The place where he stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was crossed by numerous paths, but he knew just
as much of the one path as he did about the other.
The country round him was one wide expanse of
moorland. There was nothing before him but moor,
moor, moor! He saw no object that could serve to
guide him. He merely saw the outlines of the
nearest hills faintly visible through the watery haze;
but he did not recognise them. He began to feel
himself lost on a lonesome moor.</p>

<p>He was now at his wits’ end. Having been for
some time without food, he was now becoming faint.
And yet he could not remain where he was. He again
began to run. The sky was now almost as black as
night, and the sheets of rain were falling as heavily
as before. Only the vivid flashes of lightning enabled
him to trace the direction in which he was going.
He plunged into bog after bog; extricated himself;
and then ran for life. Sometimes he came
to a likely track and followed it; but it led to
nothing,—only to a succession of tracks which led
off in various directions across the moor. At last he
ran straight forward, without paying any regard to
tracks. By continuing in this course he eventually
came to a road,—a gladsome sight, because it
must lead to some dwelling or other. But which way
should he go? He knew nothing of the direction of
the road, for he had altogether lost his reckoning,
and every landmark was invisible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REACHES A HAVEN.</i></div>

<p>After a few moments’ consideration he bethought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
him of the direction in which Huntly might possibly
lie; and as that town was his intended destination, he
faced about, as he thought, in that direction, and commenced
running again at full speed. After having
run for about a mile, he came in sight of his destined
haven,—a house. It stood on a slight elevation,
with its back to the road, and was surrounded by a
turf-and-stone wall. Collecting his remaining strength
he ran up the slope, cleared the dyke at a bound, and
rushed into the house without further ceremony.</p>

<p>He found two little maidens inside, who looked
rather frightened at his sudden appearance. And no
wonder! He must have looked more like a Lunatic
than a Naturalist. Being completely exhausted, he
threw himself right down on a seat without speaking
a single word. When he recovered his breath, he
asked pardon of the little damsels for running in so
unceremoniously; “he had been overtaken by the
storm.” He asked them if he might be allowed to
rest there until the storm ceased?</p>

<p>“I dinna ken,” said one of the girls, “oor mither’s
nae in. She’s oot breakin’ sticks; but,” she added,
“I daresay ye may.”</p>

<p>There was a good fire of sods and peats on the
floor. Edward went towards it, with his dripping
clothes, to dry himself. He now began to look at his
belongings. He first took off his hat, which was the
hiding-place for many of his treasures. He found
that the bundles of rare moss which he had picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on the moor, and also the flies which he had pinned
into the crown of his hat, were all right. His hat
was usually two-storied; we wish we could have
given a section of it. The lower part contained his
head, and the other, above it, separated by a thin
piece of board, contained mosses, birds’ eggs, butterflies,
insects, and such like.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS WALLETS EMPTIED.</i></div>

<p>He next proceeded to take off some of his wallets.
But, just as he had begun to remove them, he heard
the girls behind him twittering and giggling. Turning
round, he saw one of them pointing to his back,
and trying to suppress her mirth. He could not
imagine the reason. Another, and yet another stifled
laugh! On his looking round again, they rushed
out of the room; and then he heard them exploding
with laughter. The cause of their merriment was this.
The storm of rain had soaked Edward to the skin.
Every pocket and wallet was full of chip-boxes and
water. The glue of the boxes had melted; the ants,
worms, slugs, spiders, caterpillars, and such like, had
all escaped, and were mixed up in a confused mass.
They shortly began to creep out of the innumerable
pockets in which they had been contained. It was because
the girls had seen the mixture of half-drowned
spiders, beetles, ants, and caterpillars, creeping up the
strange man’s back, that they rushed from the place,
and laughed their full out of doors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A TERRIBLE WOMAN.</i></div>

<p>Edward was now left to himself. The girls had
doubtless gone to fetch their mother. He began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
think of beating a retreat, as he seemed to have been
the cause, in some way, of the girls leaving the house.
But at that moment, a woman, of prodigious size and
attitude, appeared at the threshold. She stood stock
still, and looked at the stranger furiously. He addressed
her, but she gave no reply. He addressed
her again, louder; but she was still silent. He looked
at her again. In one hand she grasped a most formidable-looking
axe; whilst in the other she held
what looked like the half of a young tree. She was
tall, stout, and remarkably muscular; her hair was
of a carroty-red colour, and thickly matted together.
Her dress was scanty; she was bare-legged, but
wore a pair of old unlaced boots, such as are usually
worn by ploughmen. With her axe in one hand
and her pole in the other—with her clenched teeth,
and fierce aspect—Edward could entertain no other
idea of her than that she was mad; and that her intention
was to brain him with her axe! He could
not rush past her. Her space filled the doorway.
He could not overpower her, for she was much more
powerful than he was. His suspense was dreadful.</p>

<p>At last she moved one step forward; then another,
until Edward thought he might plunge past her, and
escape. But no; she opened her lips and spoke, or
rather yelled—“Man, fat the sorra brocht ye in here,
an’ you in siccan a mess! Gang oot o’ my hoose, I
tell ye, this verra minit! Gang oot!” This appeal
brought Edward to himself again. He apologised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
her for entering her house, and begged her to let him
remain until the rain had ceased. “Not a minit,”
was the sharp rejoinder; “ye’ll pit my hoose afloat.
Ye’re a’ vermin, an’ ye’ll pit’s in a hobble if ye dinna
gang oot!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CHIP-BOXES EMPTY.</i></div>

<p>He protested that he had nothing to do with
vermin; but as he spoke he lifted up his hand to
wipe something off his cheek. It was a hairy oobit!
He was in a moment alive to the woman’s expostulations.
On looking to his clothes he found that he was
a moving mass of insect life. He cleared the room in
a bound, regardless of the woman’s axe and cudgel.
He went into an old shed, threw off his coat and
waistcoat, and found them a mass of creeping
things. On searching his pockets, he found that all
the chip-boxes had given way, and that the whole
of the collection which he had made during the last
three days was lost. He might have collected the
insects from his clothing, but he had nothing to put
them in. He now found that he was the lunatic, and
not the woman. Before he departed, he apologised
to her for the trouble he had caused her, and then he
departed homewards,—a sadder if not a wiser man.</p>

<p>After this adventure, he never again resorted to
<i>chip</i>-boxes. He used little bottles for holding beetles
and various insects. He had also a light flat box,
about nine inches square, for containing the more
fragile portion of the insect tribe, such as butterflies
and moths. Before he pinned them down, he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
them a drop of chloroform to put them to sleep, and
prevent them destroying their beautiful plumage.
When he met these tender creatures reposing on a
flower, he would always, if possible, drop a little
chloroform upon them, and thus end their struggles.
Then he boxed them. By this means he secured
many splendid specimens.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOW TO PRESERVE.</i></div>

<p>His hat was also an excellent insect-box, and a
convenient receptacle for many things. He had a false
crown put in the upper part of it, well stored with
pins. And even when he went out to walk with his
wife and children, he would occupy part of his time
in looking for and storing up moths and butterflies, so
that not an opportunity nor a moment’s time was
lost.</p>

<p>He carried his caterpillars in a tin box, with
several compartments; and his snails in a similar
box of smaller dimensions. His eggs, after being
emptied, were put into a sort of canister, and being
well packed with cotton wool, they very seldom broke,
although he carried them about with him for days
together.</p>

<p>Whenever he shot a bird or animal, his first business
was to fill up the mouth and nostrils with cotton
wadding, and then to search for the wounds and fill
them up. By this means he always got his specimens
home clean. This he found to be indispensably
necessary with sea birds, if he wished to bring them
home unsoiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Being unable to purchase presses for his plants,
he used heavy flat stones, and boxes filled with gravel
and dry sand. These answered very well, and were
all the presses he ever had.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD A REFEREE.</i></div>

<p>After his first exhibition at Banff, Edward became
a general referee as to all natural and unnatural
objects found in the district. People of all sorts
brought “things” to him, to ascertain what they were.
Sometimes they were rare objects, sometimes they
were monstrosities. His decision did not always
satisfy the inquirers; and then they sent the objects
to some other person, who, they thought, knew better.
They always found, however, that Edward had been
right in his decisions. When he knew with certainty,
he gave his opinion. When he did not know the
object, he said he could not give an opinion. And
this was, doubtless, the best course to adopt.</p>

<p>Several of his friends told him that he ought to
extend his investigations into Aberdeen, and even into
Elgin. They did not offer to help him, but they
advised him to go. He had now eight of a family,
and his wages, allowing for extra work, only amounted
to about fifteen or sixteen shillings a week. To range
the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Elgin, in search
of objects in Natural History, while he was maintaining
his family on such slender wages, was therefore
an altogether impossible task.</p>

<p>His wife was his best helper. She bound all his
upper leathers, and also the upper leathers of several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the other workmen. The wages paid to her were distinct
from the wages paid to Edward. Very often,
instead of spending her earnings on clothes or bringing
the money home, she would buy for her husband
bottles for his insects, wood for his bird-cases, or
powder and shot for his gun. None of his advising
friends ever helped him in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S CERTIFICATE.</i></div>

<p>And yet Edward did extend his investigations farther
into Banffshire, and even into Aberdeenshire.
With that view he obtained a certificate, drawn up by
the Clerk of the Peace, and signed by sixteen Justices
of the Peace, enabling him to go over the country with
his gun, in search of birds and other things. He always
carried this certificate with him; and when he
presented it to a gamekeeper, he was allowed to go
wherever he pleased. The certificate was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These are to certify that the bearer, Thomas Edward,
shoemaker, who is in height about five feet six inches, has
dark eyes and hair, much pock-pitted, round-shouldered, and
about thirty-five years of age—is, in addition to his other
calling, engaged in collecting and preserving various objects
of Natural History, particularly those objects which relate
to Ornithology (Birds), Oo-ology (Eggs), Entomology (Insects),
Helminthology (Worms, etc.), and Conchology (Shells);—That,
for the purpose of procuring Ornithological Specimens,
he is under the necessity of using a Gun, but in doing so,
We, the undersigned, have never heard of a single case of
poaching being brought against him, and, as far as we know,
he is not in the habit of killing Game of any sort, nor of destroying
property of any description, which, were he in the
practice of so doing, being so frequently out with his Gun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
he could not, we think, have escaped public notice so long,—having
resided in this town for a period of sixteen years, during
which time he has borne an unimpeachable character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOVE OF BIRD-NESTING.</i></div>

<p>Edward was now in the prime of life, yet he
was drawing very heavily upon his constitutional
powers. Sleeping out of doors nightly, whether the
weather was fair or foul, subjected him to many
attacks of cold and rheumatism. Yet he had no sooner
recovered, than he was out again at his nightly work.
He was still as wild a bird-nester as he had ever
been in his youth. He would go to any distance or
to any place, to find a bird or a bird’s nest that was
new to him. He would run up a tree like a squirrel,
and come down again with the birds or the nest.</p>

<p>He would also walk or climb up a precipice
when a nest was to be had. Of course he had many
falls. But what of that, if the object was gained?
The most dangerous fall that he ever had was at
Tarlair. The circumstance may be described, as a
specimen of the dangers which Edward ran in his
pursuit of Natural History. The author went to see
the place, and was afraid to look down into the
chasm amongst the rocks into which the Naturalist
had fallen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TARLAIR.</i></div>

<p>The little valley of Tarlair is about three miles east
of Banff. It is not far from Macduff. The road to
Tarlair is along the bare bluff coast; and when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
reach the top of a lofty point, you see beneath you a
green grassy valley indenting the rocks. At the
inner end of the valley is a little well-house, where
inland people come during summer-time, to drink
the mineral waters.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Eastward of Tarlair the rocky
cliffs ascend higher and higher,—rising to their loftiest
height in the almost perpendicular cliff of Gamrie
Mohr.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/image183.jpg" width="372" height="610" alt="rocky coast" />
<div class="caption">TARLAIR</div>
</div>

<p>The place at which Edward met with his accident,
occurred at the projecting point of the valley
above mentioned, where the rocks begin to ascend.
Not far from the mouth of the valley there is, in the
face of the rock, a very large, high, and wide-mouthed
cave or chasm, fronting the sea. The back wall of
the cave, as well as the sides, contain a number
of strange-like openings, and fantastical projections,
one of which is called “the pulpit.” Edward often
sat in the cave, and also slept in it; but he never
preached in it, though he several times brought down
sea-gulls and hoodie-crows with his gun. The bottom
of the cave is thickly covered with stones and
boulders thrown in by the sea, which, in storms,
dashes with great fury into its innermost recesses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>In the roof, and near the front of the cave, a few
martens build their nests every season. As Edward
was coming home one morning from his night’s work,
and while he was walking under the cliff, intending
to come out at Tarlair, he observed one of the martens
flying out of the cave, and shot it. Instead of
dropping at his feet, it fell on the top of the cliff.
How was he to get at the bird? He might have gone
round a considerable way, and thus reached the top
of the rock. But this would have involved the loss
of considerable time; and he was anxious to get home
to his work.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ASCENDS A PRECIPICE.</i></div>

<p>There was another way of getting at the bird, and
that was by scrambling directly up the face of the cliff.
He determined on adopting the latter course. Usually,
when ascending rocks, he used to tie his gun to his
back, as both hands were required to grip and clutch
the edges of the rock above him. But, on this
occasion, not wishing to lose further time by buckling
on his gun, he determined, dangerous though
it was, to ascend the precipice gun in hand. By
grasping the stones above him with his hands and
nails, and putting the tips of his shoes into the
crevices of the rocks, or sometimes only on to a
little tuft of grass, he contrived to haul himself up.
He managed very well until he reached about the
middle of the ascent, where a bend occurs in the
rocks. There he became fixed. To come down,
unless headlong, was impossible; and to go up seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
equally impracticable. In that case he would have
had to drop his gun, and smash it to bits on the rocks
below. This he could not afford to do. Still, he
could not stay there. With bated breath and steady
eye, he clutched a little projection of rock standing
out far above him. He caught it, clambered a little
way up, then secured a firmer footing, and at last
reached the summit in safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FALLS FROM A CLIFF.</i></div>

<p>His troubles were not over. They were only beginning.
He looked about for the bird. It lay only
a few yards from him. It was on the edge of the cliff,
and seemed apparently dead. On stooping to pick it
up, it fluttered, raised one of its wings, and went over
the precipice. In his eagerness to catch it, or perhaps
from the excited state in which he was from
mounting the cliff, Edward grasped at the bird, missed
it, lost his footing on the smooth rock, and fell over
the precipice. His gun fell out of his hand and lodged
across two rocks jutting out from the beach below.
Edward fell upon his gun, and smashed it to pieces;
but it broke the force of the blow, and probably saved
his life. A fall of at least forty feet on rocks and
stones would certainly have killed most men, or at
least broken many of their bones. When afterwards
endeavouring to recall his feelings on the occasion,
Edward said,—“I remember that, on losing my
balance, my gun slipped from my hand, and I uttered
the exclamation, ‘O God!’ Then my breath seemed
to be cut by a strong wind, which made me compress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
my lips. I shut my eyes, and felt a strange-like sensation
of a rushing sound in my ears; and then of
coming suddenly and violently, with a tremendous
thud, upon the stony rock.”</p>

<p>His breath was gone, and it was long before he
could recover it. He was for a time utterly senseless.
On slightly recovering consciousness, he thought he
was under the influence of a night-mare. He seemed
to be in bed, and saw before him hideous faces, grinning
and grimacing, like so many demons. He tried
to shake them off, to shut them out. But no! the
monsters were still there in all their hideousness, and
still he was utterly helpless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WEDGED AMONGST ROCKS.</i></div>

<p>At length two ploughmen, who had been working
in the adjoining field, and seen Edward fall over the
cliff, came forward to its edge, and looked down
upon him wedged among the rocks. “Ye’re no dead
yet, are ye?” said one of the men. Edward was
unable to make any answer. “Fa is’t?” said the other
man. “Ou! it’s that feel chiel<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that’s aye gaun
aboot wi’ his gun and his wallets!” The men looked
down again in consternation, with eyes that seemed
about to leap from their sockets. Edward at length
began to feel about him. He felt himself wedged, as
in a vice, between two long and oval pieces of rock,
and quite unable to set himself free. The two countrymen
went round by the Tarlair pathway, in order to
get Edward out of his fixture. It seemed to him an
age before they arrived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>DRAGGED OUT OF HIS VICE.</i></div>

<p>They at first took him by the shoulder and tried
to lift him out. But this was so painful to him, that
at last they desisted. They then tried to remove one
of the rocks, between which he lay clasped. This
also proved fruitless. Edward then observed that the
other rock, which they had not yet tried to remove,
consisted of a loose shale. It had either dropped
from the cliff, or been tossed inshore by the sea.
Edward desired them to try and move it a little. But
their joint efforts proved unavailing. Many attempts
were made to no purpose. A stout fisherman then
appeared on the scene. He put his shoulder to the
rock, and the block was at last moved sufficiently
far, so as to enable Edward to be dragged out of the
vice.</p>

<p>He sat down and felt himself all over. His left
shoulder and left side were extremely sore. The
back of his head was also very painful. But he
was thankful to find that neither his arms nor his
legs were broken. He was not so sure about his left
ribs. He was very much bruised and cut on that
side. One of the splinters of the gun-stock was
found sticking through his coat. An old copper
powder-flask, which he had in his left pocket, was
as flat as a flounder; all its contents were dashed
out.</p>

<p>Edward entreated the men to help him to get
to the cave. He thought that, if left there for a
time, he would soon recover. He got upon his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with difficulty, and found that his spine had been
hurt. With the help of two of the men, he was at
last able to walk very slowly to the cave. They
urged him to allow them to carry him to the cottage
near the Mineral Well. But he preferred to rest in
the cave. They prepared a bed of seaweed for him,
on which he lay down. His protectors then left
him, and, spite of his pain, he fell asleep. He must
have slept some time, for he was awakened by the
murmuring of the sea, which was fast approaching
the cave.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LEAVING THE CAVE.</i></div>

<p>Feeling that his sickly feeling had left him, and
that he was on the whole much better, although his
left side and shoulder were still very painful, he
gathered himself together and rose to his feet. He
staggered about a little at first; but he was at last
able to return in search of his gun. He found it in
a woeful plight. The stock was broken to bits, and
the barrel and lock were laid in the hollow. He
gathered up the fragments of the companion of his
travels for so many years; and, divesting himself of
the heaviest of his wallets, he left them in a corner
of the cave. Then, keeping hold of the rocks, he
contrived to reach the inner side of the Tarlair valley.
From thence he had a weary walk to Banff. He took
many rests by the way, and at length reached
home in the afternoon, sore, sick, and weary; and
went to bed. His wounds were then looked to. It
was found that none of his ribs were broken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that he had only sustained some severe contusions.
It was, however, nearly a fortnight before he could do
any work. A month elapsed before he could walk
to Tarlair for the wallets and remains of his gun
which he had left in the hollow of the cave.</p>

<p>To support his family during his illness, he was
forced to sell a considerable portion of the Collection
which he had made during the last few years. Although
it was not so large as that which he had
exhibited at Aberdeen, it contained many rarer birds,
insects, crustacea, zoophytes, and plants; and it was
on the whole much better got up. He sold about
100 cases at this time, consisting chiefly of preserved
birds, insects, and eggs. He also sold about 300
plants, and more than 200 zoophytes; besides about
100 minerals or fossils. Among the plants, were a
great number unnamed. He had as yet no botanical
books; and the friends to whom he applied could
not supply the names. They considered them very
rare, if not new and unnamed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DRAWS UPON HIS SAVINGS-BANK.</i></div>

<p>It was a great blow to him to sell a portion of
his second Collection. But he had no help for it. It
was his only Savings Bank. When other means failed
him, he could only rely upon it. He had no friends
in his neighbourhood to help him. His specimens
went to many places, far and near. A considerable
portion of them went to Haslar, near Southampton,
where one of the hospital surgeons was making a
collection of objects in Natural History.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small><i>BEGINS TO PUBLISH HIS OBSERVATIONS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Shortly</span> after Edward’s return from Aberdeen, his
old and much esteemed friend, the Rev. James Smith,
of the Manse of Monquhitter, situated about ten
miles south-east of Banff, lent him some works on
Natural History. These enabled Edward to ascertain
the names of some of the birds which he discovered
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>One day, while walking along the sea-coast, Edward
shot a Bridled Guillemot (<i>Uria lachrymans</i>),—a
bird not before known to frequent the district.
When he informed Mr. Smith of the circumstance, the
reverend gentleman thus wrote to him: “The discovery
of the Bridled Guillemot at Gamrie is very
interesting, and affords another confirmation of the
remark that there are many things yet to be found out,
almost at our doors, by those who have a relish for the
works of Nature, and who will make a good use of
the faculties which the Almighty has bestowed upon
them. In my own case, I have now almost <i>no</i> opportunity
in my power for prosecuting researches in
Natural History out of doors; and, even if I had,
there is so little sympathy for any proceedings of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nature, that I should to a certainty be regarded, by
almost all my parishioners, as half-mad, or at least
as childish, and neglecting my more serious duties.
Still, I always feel a strong interest in the subject,
and in any discovery which is made in regard to it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD AND GRAMMAR.</i></div>

<p>As Edward had no narrow-minded parishioners
to encounter, he went on with his researches. Mr.
Smith strongly encouraged him to persevere. He
also advised him to note down the facts which came
under his notice; and to publish the results of his
observations. This surprised Edward. “Why,” said
he, “I cannot write for the publishers.” “You must
learn to write,” said Mr. Smith; “and in order to
write correctly you must study grammar.”</p>

<p>He importuned Edward so much, that at last he
said he “had no use for grammar.” “You cannot
write without it,” said Mr. Smith. “But,” returned
Edward, “I have no intention of writing.” “You <i>must</i>
write,” said Mr. Smith. “You must write down all
that you learn respecting the objects you are collecting.
It is a duty that you owe to society, and it will
be very selfish on your part if you do not publish the
results of your observations.”</p>

<p>After about half-an-hour’s arguing, Edward asked,
“How long do you think it would take me to learn
grammar?” “Well,” said Mr. Smith, “I do not
think you would take very long to learn it. But,”
he added, “you will require to relinquish your out-door
pursuits during that time.” “If that be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
case, Mr. Smith, I am afraid that I cannot become
a pupil. But, if I have any time left after I have
done with Nature, then perhaps I may begin to study
grammar; but not till then.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S SCRAPS.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Smith’s advice, however, was not without its
good results. Edward <i>did</i> begin to note down his
observations about natural objects, and he published
them from time to time in the local paper, the <i>Banffshire
Journal</i>. When the present author asked for a
sight of the articles, Edward replied, “I think I could
supply you with scraps of a good number, although, on
looking over my stock, I find that a great many have
disappeared. My family and friends have dealt very
freely with them. In fact, they were found good for
‘kinlin’.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The most of what I wrote in the local
papers is lost, for ever lost.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH’S-HEAD MOTH.</i></div>

<p>Among the articles which he was able to collect,
we find descriptions of rare moths, rare birds, and
rare fishes. Perhaps one of the first articles which he
published, was a description of a “Death’s-head
Moth” found in the parish of Ruthven—one of the
most wonderful, as it is one of the most extraordinary
of insects.</p>

<p>“In its caterpillar state,” says Edward, “it has the
power of making a pretty loud snapping-like noise,
which has been compared by some to a series of
electric sparks. The chrysalis squeaks, but more
particularly when about to change. And, as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
perfect insect itself, it is gifted with a voice which it
has the power of modulating at pleasure, being sometimes
of a plaintive nature, then mournful, then like
the moaning of a child, then again like the squeaking
of a mouse. This, together with the fact that it
carries on a portion of its back,—that part called the
thorax,—an impression of the front view of a human
skull (hence its name of Death’s-head), has made it
an object of the greatest terror and dislike amongst
the ignorant and superstitious. It is looked upon,
not as the handiwork of the Almighty, but as the
agent of evil spirits. The very shining of its large
bright eyes, which sparkle like diamonds, is believed
to represent the fiery element from which it is supposed
to have sprung. On one occasion these insects
appeared in great abundance in various districts of
Bretagne, and produced great trepidation among the
inhabitants, who considered them to be the forerunners,
and even the causes, of epidemic diseases
and other calamities. In the Isle of France it is believed
that any down or dust from their wings falling
on the eyes causes immediate blindness. All this is,
of course, merely the result of superstitious prejudice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BUTTERFLIES AND LOCUSTS.</i></div>

<p>“The Death’s-head is said to be the largest moth
we have, and is, in fact, the largest found inhabiting
Europe, save the Peacock moth. Be this as it may,
it is a very large insect, measuring from five to six
inches across the wings, and having a body proportionately
long and thick. The caterpillar, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
smooth, and of a greenish-yellow, with minute black
dots all over, and with seven or eight bluish stripes
on the sides, having a horn above the tail, is likewise
very large,—being, when full grown, about six inches
long. It feeds on the potato, the deadly-nightshade,
the jasmine, and the <i>Lycium barbarum</i>, and other
plants of as dissimilar a nature.”</p>

<p>In another article he mentioned the Herald Moth
(<i>Scaliopteryx libatrix</i>), a specimen of which was presented
to him by Mrs. G. Bannerman. He describes
this beautiful insect as occurring in great profusion
in some of the southern parts of England, but as very
rare in the north. It is called the “Herald” moth,
because it is said to indicate the approach of winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOCUSTA MIGRATORIA.</i></div>

<p>The Peacock Butterfly (<i>Papilio Io</i>), was caught in
Duff House garden, close to Banff. Although common
in England, this butterfly is very rare in Scotland.
Morris makes no mention of its ever having been
seen in the north. A great flock of these butterflies
passed over a part of Switzerland in 1828, when they
were described as a swarm of locusts. This circumstance
led Edward to insert some observations regarding
that destructive insect, the <i>Locusta migratoria</i>,
which passed over this country in the year 1846, the
ever-memorable potato-famine year.</p>

<p>“Great numbers,” he says, “were found in the
counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray. Several
were also got in the sea at Aberdeen, as well as near
Banff. Some of those found were very large, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
two and a half inches long, and nearly as thick
as one’s little finger; their wings expanding to about
four inches in breadth. Nine of this size were found
by one individual in a turnip-field at the Stocket, near
Aberdeen. They were brought to me while I was
there with my first unfortunate Collection. But, large
though this may seem, it is nothing to others. We
are told that in India there are locusts of a yard in
length. I do not vouch for the fact; it is no story
of mine. Pliny tells it; and from him we have it.
Some found in the sea at Aberdeen were offered
there for sale as ‘fleein’ fish,’ and no less a sum than
ten shillings was sought for them. Strange sort of
flying-fish this! Truly it may have been said that
the entomological and ichthyological schoolmasters
were both abroad in those days. It may, however,
be remarked, that something of a similar kind
took place amongst ourselves not very long ago,
so that we have little room to laugh at the Aberdonians.
A person having picked up a <i>galerite</i> (a
species of fossilised sea-urchin of the Cretaceous
system), near by our harbour, was showing it to some
individuals, when one of them, no doubt puzzled,
said, ‘O! it’s just something that <i>somebody has made</i>.’
But to return to the locusts. Those of which we have
been speaking arrived in the month of August
and the beginning of September. Now, this year it
would appear that something of the same kind had
taken place, as numbers have been picked up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
various parts of the country. Three have, at least,
been found with us, viz. two near the Moss of Banff,
and one at Cornhill; another at Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire.
I have also one from Lerwick, where it is said
they have been rather plentiful in the corn-fields;
as also in the Zetland Islands, in Unst, and the rest
of the bare and isolated Skerries. In some of the
Western Isles, I believe, they have actually proved a
complete pest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THEIR DESTRUCTIVE POWER.</i></div>

<p>“As may be expected, there are many species of
this creature, as there are of everything else: but
those here alluded to are perhaps the most redoubtable
of them all, as being the most destructive, the
best known from their migratorial flights, and being,
as already hinted, the species that constituted one of
the awful plagues of Egypt in the days of Moses.
They were doubtless the same that wasted the land of
Canaan, and caused such a terrible famine, of which
we read in the book of Joel. A wind drove them
into the sea; their dead bodies were again cast on
shore in such heaps that the Hebrews were obliged
to dig large pits in which to bury them. In this
country, we have about twenty-five different kinds
belonging to the same family, of which the foregoing
is one; but of course they are all of small size, and
therefore may be said to be comparatively harmless.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SAW-FLIES.</i></div>

<p>In another article, Edward mentions another insect
almost equally destructive. A friend of Edward at
Turriff found four <i>Saw-flies</i> in a piece of a fir tree that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was being cut up for firewood. They are called <i>Saw-flies</i>
“from the fact that the female possesses, posteriorly,
an instrument by which she perforates, or rather saws,
holes in trees, into which she drops her eggs. From
this it will be seen that the larvæ are woodfeeders.
In this country they are by no means numerous, and
it is well that they are not, or our forests would shortly
disappear; for, in places where they abound, such as
in Norway, they destroy hundreds of thousands of
trees in a season. It is only the growing and not the
dead wood that they attack. The young grubs, as
soon as they emerge from the egg, cut their way right
into the very heart of the solid timber, and there
they gnaw and bore in every possible direction.
By this means, the tree is either killed, or so injured,
that ultimately it pines and dies. The fly itself has
no English name, but is known to entomologists by
the term of <i>Sirex juvencus</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PATIENT SPIDER.</i></div>

<p>In another article, Edward mentions the fact of a
Spider (<i>Aranea domestica</i>) having lived in one of his
sealed-up cases for twelve months without food. He
had before written to his reverend friend on the
subject, but Mr. Smith informed him that he had no
books on Entomology, and could give him no information.
Edward says of his spider, that after the case had
been sealed up, he saw him walking over the birds contained
there, until at last he became stationary in one
of the corners. “Towards noon of the second day of
his incarceration, he commenced operations, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
breakfast time of the day following, his web was
completed. The little artizan was then observed to
walk slowly and very sedately all over the newly
formed fabric, seemingly with the view of ascertaining
if all was secure. This done, the aperture was
next examined, and with more apparent care than
was bestowed upon the rest of the structure. This
wonderful mechanical contrivance,—which serves at
least the fourfold purpose of storehouse, banqueting
hall, watch tower, and asylum in times of danger,—being
found all right, the artificer then took up his
station, within it, no doubt to await the success of
the net which he had spread, and from whence, had
fortune proved kind, he would boldly have rushed out
to secure his struggling prey. There was, however, no
fly to be caught within the case. He was the only
living thing in it; and there the patient creature
remained without food, for the space of more than
twelve months.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>NOTES ON NATURAL HISTORY.</i></div>

<p>The notices on Natural History which appeared
from time to time in the local journal, had the effect of
directing general attention to the observation of
natural objects; and numerous birds, fishes, insects,
caterpillars, shells, and plants, were sent to
Edward for examination.</p>

<p>In one of his notes he mentions a Cinereous
Shearwater (<i>Puffinus cinereus</i>) found on the beach
near Portsoy. This led him to give a very vivid
account of the Stormy Petrel. Another of the specimens
sent to him was a <i>Dyphalcanthus longispinus</i>,
from the fossil diggings of Gamrie. “How strange!”
he says. “Here we have an animal, or perhaps I
should rather say a stone, part of which had once
been a creature enjoying life,—but now how changed!
How long is it since it lived, died, and became thus
transformed? Years ago, nay ages, many ages, long
anterior to the creation of man. How wonderful, and
yet how true!”</p>

<p>Of another specimen he says—</p>

<p>“Here, again, is a black, pink, yellow, and brown
creature, with crests and ornaments like a duchess—just,
in fact, like a lady of the olden time, dressed
up and decorated for a ball, with her head stuck full
of feathers, her ribbons flying, and fan in hand; in
other words, a caterpillar of the Vapourer Moth found
in a garden at Buckie.</p>

<p>“And lastly, though not least, a specimen of the
Mountain Bladder fern (<i>Cystopteris montana</i>), found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
on Benrinnes by a gentleman from England, and sent
to me as a rarity. It was only in 1836 that this fern
was made known as British, having then been for
the first time met with by a party of naturalists on
Ben Lawers. Since that time, however, it has been
found in a ravine between Glen Dochart and Glen
Lochy, Perthshire. It is also found on the mountains
of North Wales, on the Alps, and on the Rocky Mountains
of North America.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RARE BIRDS.</i></div>

<p>Many rare birds were sent to him for examination,
notices of which he recorded in the local
paper. Thus, he obtained the Little Crake (<i>Crex
pusilla</i>), a bird that had not before been found in the
neighbourhood, from a land-surveyor at Whitehills.
The Mountain Finch (<i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>) was
sent to him from Macduff, where it had been driven
ashore during a recent storm. A Greater Shrike or
Butcher bird (<i>Lanius excubitor</i>)—a bird that had not
before been found in Scotland,—was found dead at
Drummuir Castle, and sent to him for preservation.
The Spoonbill (<i>Platalea leucorodia</i>) and Bee-eater
(<i>Merops apiaster</i>)—very rare birds—were also found
at Boyndie.</p>

<p>Of the latter bird, Edward says, “This is a
splendid bird, as rare as the last, if not more so. If we
except the breast, which is of a bright yellow, encircled
by a black ring, and some other orange and
brown scattered here and there, it may be said to be
of a beautiful verdigris green. The two middle tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
feathers are about an inch longer than the others.
The bill is longish and pointed. Though termed bee-eaters,
they also feed on beetles, gnats, grasshoppers,
and flies, etc. The most of these they capture on the
wing, somewhat after the fashion of the Goatsucker
and Swallow. Although a scarce bird with us, they
are common in their native countries. In Asia
Minor and the adjacent lands to the north, and in
Northern Africa, they are said to be so abundant as
to be seen flying about in thousands.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ACCURATE OBSERVERS WANTED.</i></div>

<p>Among the rarer birds found in the district, were
the Bohemian Waxwing or Chatterer (<i>Bombycilla
garrula</i>), whose native home is Bohemia,—the Black
Redstart (<i>Phœnicurus Tithys</i>), a bird that had never
before been met with in Scotland. Edward, in describing
this bird, says, “It is quite possible that it
may have visited the country before; but from the
neglect, or rather contempt, with which natural
science is regarded in this part of the country, it may
have visited us, and even bred amongst us, unknown
and unrecorded. There is plenty of work among us
for Naturalists. A great deal has yet to be learnt
regarding the various branches of natural science.
There is nothing better calculated for the purpose
than <i>attentive and accurate local observers</i>.”</p>

<p>On one occasion, when out shooting on the sands
west of Banff, Edward brought down a very rare
bird. It was a brown snipe (<i>Macroramphus griseus</i>),
a bird well known in North America, but not in
Britain. Here is Edward’s story:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A STRANGE BIRD OBSERVED.</i></div>

<p>“Taking a stroll the other day to the west of the
town, with my gun in hand, to get the air, I
crossed the sands at the Links, and looking along
them I observed a pretty large group of my old
and long-loved favourites—birds. Wishing, instinctively
as it were, to know what they were, I went
cautiously forward to take a nearer view. I found
that they consisted for the most part of ring-dotterels
and dunlins, with a few golden plovers. I was
somewhat astonished at seeing the plovers, for they
are by no means a shore bird with us at this season
of the year,—nor, in fact, at any time, except when
driven by snow. But there they were, and no mistake.
Not yet satisfied, however,—for I thought I
could distinguish one that did not exactly belong to
any of those already mentioned,—I wished to go a
little nearer, and on doing so was glad to find my
conjectures fully confirmed; but what the stranger
was I could not tell. I saw enough, however, to
convince me that it was a rare bird. There is no
getting an easy shot at a stranger. The dotterels
are constantly on the out-look for squalls, and when
anything suspicious appears, they immediately rise
and fly away. A shot, however, after a good deal of
winding and twisting, was fired, and although at
rather long range, broke one of the stranger’s legs.
This had the effect of parting him from his companions,—they
flying seawards, and he to the shingle
which intervenes betwixt the sands and the Links.
Here he dropped, seemingly to rise no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A BROWN SNIPE.</i></div>

<p>“Having reloaded in case of need, I then ran, as
well as I was able, to pick him up. I gained the place,
and after some difficulty, having passed and repassed
him several times, I at last found my bird lying
stretched out at full length amongst the pebbles, and
to all appearance a corpse. It was now that I ascertained
with satisfaction and pride, that the great
rarity I had met with was neither more nor less than
a specimen of the Brown Snipe, and a splendid one
it was too, being evidently an old bird. Being
almost intoxicated with delight, I sat down, and having
taken some cotton wadding from my pocket to
wrap round the injured leg, and stop up any other
wound that he might have received, I took him up
for that purpose. But, alas! there is many a slip between
the cup and the lip.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SNIPE ESCAPES.</i></div>

<p>“Away flew the bird just as I was about to lay
him on my knee; he actually slipped out from
amongst my very fingers. I fired both barrels as
soon as I could get a hold of my gun, sitting though
I was. But on the bird went, whistling as he flew,
despite the dangling of his shattered limb, but
whether in derision at my stupidity, or exulting in
his own miraculous and fortunate escape, I cannot
tell. Reaching the burn mouth of Boyndie, he again
alighted amongst the tumbling waves there. It was
now gloaming, and what between one thing or
other, I was rather like an aspen leaf than anything
else. Follow, however, I did; I searched the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and was just on the eve of giving up the pursuit as
hopeless—having, as I thought, beat the ground over
and over again to no purpose,—when up rose
the bird from amongst my very feet. Both barrels
were again emptied, but with little apparent
effect. The last one made him scream somewhat
harshly, and falter a little in his flight, but that was
all. On he sped. Darkness now put an end to any
further operations for that day. Next day, however,
and for many days after, I was out, but, although
I searched the coast as far as the sands of Whitehills
on the one side, and the burn of Melrose on
the other, I could find no traces of the bird. And
thus I lost perhaps one of the greatest ornithological
rarities that has ever visited the district.”</p>

<p>One of the most vivid descriptions which Edward
inserted in the <i>Banffshire Journal</i>, was a narrative of
a day’s adventures on Gamrie Head. The editor,
in introducing it to his readers, said that it reads not
unlike a chapter of Audubon or Wilson. The reader
will judge for himself:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXCURSION TO GAMRIE.</i></div>

<p>“Having promised to visit some friends in Gardenstown
to partake of their hospitality during the
festive season of the New Year, I left home with that
object on the morning of the 31st of December
1850. I passed through Macduff, and took the path
which leads along the cliffs, hoping thereby to meet
with something rare or strange in the ornithological
world, and worthy of my shot. In this way I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
nearly reached the highest point of Gamrie Head
without meeting with anything but the common
tenants of these rocky braes, when my attention was
attracted by the screaming of a number of birds at
the bottom of the cliff. On looking over I observed
that they consisted of several hooded and carrion
crows, together with two ravens, two Iceland gulls
(<i>Laurus Islandicus</i>), and a number of other dark-coloured
gulls, apparently immature specimens of
the great black-backed species, one of which, in perfect
plumage, was standing and picking at an object
floating in the water close to the rock, and about
which all the other birds were screaming. It appeared
to me, and it afterwards proved to be the case,
that they were making food of the object about which
they were fighting; but the black-backed bird
kept them all at bay, allowing none to approach, not
even the ravens themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image201.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="coastal scene, town in background" />
<div class="caption">GAMRIE HEAD.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FOX’S LAIR.</i></div>

<p>“Having feasted my eyes for a while on the
Icelanders, the thought struck me that I would
descend the cliff in order to procure one of them if
possible, and also to get a nearer view of the object
which had drawn the various birds together. Accordingly,
observing a narrow track near me, I commenced
my descent, but I had only proceeded a short
distance when I found myself on the brink of a precipice.
I was about to return, when, accidentally
looking over, I observed a portion of the rock jutting
out a little beyond the one on which I stood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
about four feet and a half below it. I now concluded
that, if I could gain this rock, I would still find the
path to enable me to continue downwards. With
these hopes, and having laid down my gun, I swung
myself down upon the rock. I had no sooner done
so, than I heard a low growl, as if proceeding from a
rabid dog; and on looking along the rock, I was a
good deal surprised at seeing two foxes standing in
a rather slouching attitude at the other end of the
shelf, apparently very much discomfited at my unwarrantable
intrusion.</p>

<p>“Another look at the place and its surly occupants
was enough to convince me of the unmistakable truth
that, instead of having met with a path leading to
the bottom of the cliffs, I had only found one to a
fox’s lair. My first impulse was to ascend the rocks,
but in this I was completely baffled. The brow of
the cliff to which I wished to ascend, was fully as
high as my breast, and overhung the rock on which I
stood. I had nothing of the nature of a step to put
my foot on to aid myself up, and nothing to lay
hold of with my hands but small tufts of withered
grass and some small stones, all of which gave way
so soon as any stress was put upon them. The last
and the only remaining object within my reach was
a stone about twice as large as my head, and partially
embedded amongst the grass. I took hold of the
big stone with both hands, and succeeded in drawing
myself about half-way up when it suddenly gave way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
The stone came into collision with my right shoulder,
and would in all likelihood have borne me along with
it to the bottom of the cliff, had it not been that at
that instant I got hold of a short tuft of heath with
my mouth, by the aid of which, and by using my
fingers as a beast would its claws, I was enabled to
regain my former position.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DRIVES OUT THE FOXES.</i></div>

<p>“It was now quite evident that I would require
to descend the cliff by some means or other, but how?
That was a matter for deep consideration. I was
standing on the brink of a precipice,—had two cunning
fellows to deal with,—had to hold on, at least
with one hand, to the rock above in order to maintain
my equilibrium,—and had to keep a steady eye
on my companions for fear lest they should rush at
me and throw me over the cliff.</p>

<p>“Such being the case, was I not in a pretty fix?
If there were any means of escape, it was from the
point near which the foxes were. But how could I
dislodge them to get at that point? The space on
which we stood was only from about two feet and a
half to one foot broad, and about nine feet long,
projecting to some distance over the cliff beneath.
To have shot them, and rid myself of their presence
in that fashion, was, from my position, utterly impossible.</p>

<p>“At length a thought struck me, and with the
view of putting it in execution, I laid down my
gun close to the back of the shelving, out of harm’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
way; then crouching down with my feet towards my
shaggy friends, who kept up a constant chattering of
their teeth during the whole time, and pushing myself
backwards until I reached the nearest, I gave
him a kick with my foot on the hind quarters, which
produced the desired effect; for I had no sooner done
so, than I felt first the feet of one and then of the other
passing lightly along my back, and before I had time
to lift up my head, they had bolted up the precipice
and disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OVERLOOKING THE PRECIPICE.</i></div>

<p>“I was now master of the place, though not of the
situation. On looking over the cliff, I found that
there was no way of getting down but by leaping into
a crevice of the rocks, more than eight feet beneath
me, and in a slanting direction from where I was.
This was a doleful discovery, but there was no help
now; so, taking off my coat, shot-belt, and powder-flask,
that I might be so much the lighter, and have
the free use of my arms, I threw them down to the
bottom of the rock. I next bound the gun to my
back, having previously emptied it of its contents. I
then crawled over the edge of the rock, and hung
dangling in the air for a little, like the pendulum of
a clock. I would have given all that I ever possessed
in the world to have been again in the foxes’ den,
stinking though it was. For then, and not till then,
did I discover, to my sorrow, that a rugged portion of
a rock projected over the entrance to the aperture to
which I wished to descend, and that, in leaping, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
would require to go beyond it in order to reach the
landing underneath. To accomplish such a feat
seemed to me impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MAKES THE LEAP.</i></div>

<p>“I hung thus, being afraid to make the leap, though
up I could not get, until my hands began to give
way; when, mustering all my remaining strength,
and having taken the last swing with some force, I
let go my hold to abide by the dreadful alternative,—for
I had little hope of gaining the desired haven.
Most fortunately, however, I did gain it, but, in doing
so, I received a severe blow on the left temple from
the rock I had so much dreaded. I also lost my
cap, which fell off when my head struck the rock.
From this cavity or chink, which was the worst that
I ever had to deal with, I managed,—by leaping and
swinging from one rocky shelf and cavity to another,
and by crawling from crag to crag, alternately, as
circumstances required it,—to reach a huge stone,
which evidently had once formed a part of the higher
portion of the cliff, but had, at a bygone period, by
some means or other, become detached from it, and on
rolling down had found a temporary resting-place
there.</p>

<p>“Beyond this stone, I found my leaping was at an
end, for I had now arrived at the top of a rather
rough and almost perpendicular declivity, fully fifty
feet from the bottom, and bounded on both sides by
steep and overhanging cliffs. Before me was the sea,
behind and above me was an insurmountable barrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of 300 feet of cliff. Although I had descended thus
far, there was no human possibility of my being able
to re-ascend by the same path. In such a place—alone,
and almost powerless—bruised and nearly worn
out with exertion—what could I do? Throw myself
down, and meet my fate at once, or wait till help
should arrive? But where was help to come from?
Two boats had already passed from Gardenstown,
both of which I hailed, but they sailed along on their
way. Perhaps they were too far out at sea to hear
my cries, or to notice my signals of distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PEREGRINE FALCON.</i></div>

<p>“Despairing of success, I sat down to consider what
was next to be done. While thus resting, I observed
a falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>) sailing slowly and steadily
along, bearing something large in his talons. On he
came, seemingly unconscious of my presence, and
alighted on a ledge only a few yards from where I
sat. I now saw that the object he carried was a
partridge. Having fairly settled down with his
quarry on the rock, I could not help wondering at and
admiring the collected ease and cool composure with
which he held his struggling captive (for it was
still alive) until death put an end to its sufferings.
There was no lacerating with his beak at the body of
the poor and unfortunate prisoner, in order, as it were,
to hasten its termination; no expanding of the wing
to maintain his equilibrium; although the last and
dying struggle of the bird caused him to quiver a
little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEVOURS THE PARTRIDGE.</i></div>

<p>“All being now over, with one foot resting upon
his game, and the other on the rock, silent and
motionless as a statue, the noble captor stood, with an
inquiring eye gazing at the now lifeless form of his
reeking prey, seeming to doubt the fact that it was
already dead. But there was no mistake. The blood,
oozing from its mouth and wounds, its body doubtless
pierced by the talons of the conqueror, already
began to trickle down the sides of the dark cliffs,
dyeing the rocks in its course. Satisfied at last
that life was fairly extinct, an incision was then
made in the neck or shoulder of the victim, and into
this the falcon thrust his bill several times, and each
time that it was withdrawn it was covered with
blood. This being done, and having wrenched off the
head, which he dropped, he then began not only to
pluck but to skin his food, from the neck downwards;
and, having bared the breast, commenced a hearty
meal by separating the flesh from the sternum into
portions, with as much apparent ease as if he had
been operating with the sharpest surgical instrument.
I should have liked well to have seen the end of the
work thus begun; but unfortunately, a slight movement
on my part was detected by the quick eye of
the falcon, and my nearness was discovered. Having
gazed at me for a few, and only for a few seconds,
with an angry and piercing scowl, mingled with
surprise, he then rose, uttering a scream so wild and
so loud as to awaken the echoes of the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
rocks; whilst he himself, with the remains of his
feast, which he bore along with him, rounded a point
of the cliff and disappeared; and there is no doubt
that he ended his repast in unmolested security.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLIGHT OF THE FALCON.</i></div>

<p>“I was glad, nay proud, of this unlooked-for
occurrence, as I had never before, on any occasion,
had the pleasure of witnessing any of those noble
birds in a state of nature, or while engaged in
devouring their prey, and that too amongst the
rugged fastnesses of their natural retreat. In consequence
of having paid particular attention to the
movements of the falcon, I was enabled to bring to
maturity an opinion, the seeds of which were sown
many years ago—viz. that, if painters, engravers,
and preservers of animals, would endeavour to get
lessons from nature, and work accordingly, the public
would not be so often duped as they are, by having
to pay for false representations and caricatured
figures, instead of the genuine forms of these noble
birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SLIDES DOWN THE ROCKS.</i></div>

<p>“The falcon had no sooner fled, than the reality
of my own situation again burst upon my mind. I
had as little prospect of relief from passers-by as
ever; and, becoming a prey to evil forebodings, I felt
cold and sick at heart. It was now afternoon, and
daylight would soon be on the wane. I had no time
to lose, for it was necessary that something should be
done to extricate myself, if possible, before dark. The
only way of doing so was by sliding down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
declivity, be the consequences what they might.
Accordingly, I unloosed the gun from its place on my
back, and having taken my garters, which were very
long, from my legs, I tied them together, then attached
one end of them to the gun, and holding the
other end in my hand, I dropped it as far as the string
would allow, and then letting go, I heard the gun clash
to the bottom. I next took the two napkins, which
had bound the gun to my back, and wound them round
my head, in order to save it as much as possible
from the edges of the rocks. I then stretched myself
upon the rocky slope, with my feet downwards, and
was ready for the descent, when, repenting, I would
again have drawn myself up. But the scanty herbage
which I held by gave way, and I was hurled down,
whether I would or no, and with such violence that,
on landing amongst the rocks, I became quite unconscious.</p>

<p>“On recovering, I found myself lying at the foot
of the cliff, sick and very sore. I found that I had
bled profusely from the nose and one of my ears.
My first impulse, on recovering, was to move my
limbs to ascertain if any of them were broken, when,
to my inexpressible joy and thankfulness, I found
them whole, though somewhat benumbed. Becoming
thirsty, and observing a pool of water at a short
distance, I attempted to rise, but my spine pained
me so much that I was obliged to lie down again,
without being able to reach the desired spot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
thirst increasing, I dragged myself to the water. I
thrust my mouth into it, and had partaken of a
draught before I discovered that, instead of fresh, I
had swallowed <i>salt water</i>!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOADS HIS GUN.</i></div>

<p>“If I was ill before, I was worse now. Having
sickened and vomited again, I revived a little, and after
I had washed the blood from my face and head, I
was enabled to sit up with my back against a rock.
Whilst thus seated, I observed all the articles which
had been dropped, except my cap, which, however, I
afterwards found. After sitting for about half-an-hour,
I made another attempt to rise, and succeeded, though
I reeled about like a drunken fellow, and could scarcely
stand steady without the aid of my gun, which I found
was not so much bruised as I had expected. Having
again assumed my coat and other appendages, I
then endeavoured to load my gun with the view of
procuring one of the Icelanders which I had seen
from the top of the cliff. This, however, proved a
very difficult matter; and when I had loaded the gun
I found to my disappointment that I could not bring
it to bear upon the object. I made the attempt several
times, but was at last obliged to abandon the hope I
had entertained of obtaining either of the birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPINOUS SHARK.</i></div>

<p>“I was vexed at this, for both came several times
within easy shot. All my hopes of procuring the
birds being at an end, I then proceeded to view
the object in the water round which the birds were
hovering, and I was surprised to find it to be the carcase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of an animal of a very singular appearance. It
was not until I had looked at it for some time that I
could bring my memory to bear upon it. I then
thought, and I have since been fully confirmed in the
opinion, that I discovered in it a specimen, or rather
the putrid remains, of the Spinous Shark. It wanted
the head, which had been broken off by the fish having
been dashed against the rocks by the waves. The
tail was also broken off, but still hung by a filament
to the body. In shape it somewhat resembled the
tail of the common dog-fish, but there evidently had
been two fins on the back, nearer to the posterior
than the anterior portion of the animal, though
these had been broken or rubbed off. The skin,
which was of a dark blue colour, and had a leathery
appearance, was thickly beset with curved thorns or
spines (whence the animal’s name), nearly all of which
were more or less damaged. I know of nothing that
I could liken these thorns or spikes to, but the thorns
or spikes which may be seen on the stem of an old
rose bush,—with this exception, that the spikes of
the fish are larger. From its position in the water,
though close to the rocks, I could not make out its
girth in any part whatever; but, from where the
head had joined the body to the tip of the tail, it was
about two yards in length. Having fully satisfied
myself that the present specimen, from its decomposed
state and the holes perforated in it by the
gulls, was beyond the state for preservation, I again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
left it, that the impatient birds might once more
descend and recommence their banquet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RETURNS HOME.</i></div>

<p>“I now wished to get to a sandy beach, at some
distance to my left, known as Greenside, from which
I knew that a path led to the top of the cliff. On my
way thither, I met with a very serious obstacle in the
form of a huge rock, whose base extended into the
sea; and, as a matter of course, as I could not get
round it, I required to get over it. I was then far
from being in a condition to climb a rock. However,
I had no alternative. The tide, then about to come in,
would have shown me no mercy. Accordingly, my
gun was once more on my back, and on hands and
knees, for feet here were of no use, and with the aid
of my mouth, I succeeded in crawling over, and, with
some further difficulty, I contrived to reach Greenside.
Instead of holding on to Gardenstown, I turned my
face towards home, where I arrived betwixt five and
six in the evening,—with the impression of the last
day of 1850 so deeply stamped upon my body and
mind, that it will not easily, if ever, be obliterated
from either.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small><i>RAMBLES AMONGST BIRDS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Reverend Mr. Smith must have felt surprised at
the graphic manner in which Edward described the
birds of the district. The truth is, that Edward,
though he had acquired his principal knowledge from
observation, had also learnt something from books.
Mr. Smith had lent him such books as he had in his
library, and also referred him to the articles on
Natural History in the <i>Penny Cyclopedia</i>. Although
Edward did not accept his friend’s advice as to the
study of grammar, yet he learnt enough for his purpose.
It is not so much by recollecting the rules of
grammar that one learns to write, as by the careful
reading of well-written books. After that, grammar
comes, as it were, by nature. Besides, if a man feels
keenly, he will be sure to write vividly. This was
precisely Edward’s position.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith thought it unfortunate that Edward’s
contributions to Natural History should be confined
to the local newspaper. He asked permission to send
an account of his observations to a scientific journal.
Edward expressed his fears lest his contributions
might not be found worthy of notice. He was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
shy and modest: perhaps he was too modest. There
are cases in which shyness is almost a misfortune. A
man may know much; but, because of his shyness, he
declines to communicate his information to others.
He hides his secret, and nobody is the wiser for his
knowledge. He is too bashful. He avoids those who
might be friendly to him, and who might help him.
Edward often stood in his own light in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OBSERVATIONS PUBLISHED.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Smith, however, persevered. He obtained
from Edward some notes of his observations, and
after correcting them, he offered to send them to the
<i>Zoologist</i>, and publish them under his own name. “I
have no doubt,” he said, “that the articles would be
acceptable to the editor; but, if you do not approve
of this plan, I hope you will not for a moment allow
me to interfere with you. At all events, I trust that
you will have no objection to let the information be
known to a much wider circle of readers, and especially
of zoologists, than are likely to consult the pages
of the <i>Banffshire Journal</i>.”</p>

<p>Edward at last gave his consent; and in the
<i>Zoologist</i> for 1850,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Mr. Smith inserted a notice of
the Sanderlings which had been shot by Edward on
the sands of Boyndie. In the following year Mr.
Smith inserted, in the same magazine, a notice of the
spinous shark which Edward had seen under Gamrie
Head.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> “In order,” says Mr. Smith, “to determine
whether it was the spinous shark or not, I sent Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Edward the 39th volume of the ‘Naturalist’s Library,’
which contains an account, by Dr. Hamilton of
Edinburgh, of the Squalida, or family of sharks,
and in which there is a coloured engraving of this
particular shark. In reply, Mr. Edward observes—‘I
have now no doubt whatever that the animal discovered
and examined by me was the Spinous Shark.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD DESCRIBED BY MR. SMITH.</i></div>

<p>In another article, Mr. Smith described Edward
in the following terms:—“I have oftener than
once made mention in the <i>Zoologist</i> of Mr. Thomas
Edward, shoemaker in Banff, who is a zealous
admirer of Nature and an excellent preserver of
animals. Occasionally he tears himself, as it
were, from the employment to which necessity
compels him, and slakes his thirst for the contemplation
of zoological scenes and objects by a
solitary ramble amid the mountains and hills
which so greatly abound in the upper portion of the
shires of Aberdeen and Banff. Of some of his adventures
during a ramble of this description, he has
sent me an account. This I consider so interesting,
that I have rewritten it, and now submit it for insertion
in the <i>Zoologist</i>. The facts, the ideas, and the
reflections, are all his own, and in many parts
I have retained his own impressions. Upon the
accuracy and the minuteness of his observations, and
upon his veracity of character, the utmost reliance
may at all times be placed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BEAUTIFUL HERON.</i></div>

<p>The paper that follows consists of the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of a ramble, extending over several days, in the hill
districts near Noth and Kirknie. It is not necessary
to transcribe the whole paper; but we may select the
following passages as showing the keen observation
as well as the character of the man. Edward had
entered a narrow glen, at the bottom of which runs
the burn called Ness Bogie. He was listening to the
voice of the cuckoo, and the <i>clap-clap</i> of the ring
pigeons, which rose in great numbers, when an abrupt
turn of the road brought him, suddenly and unexpectedly,
within a few yards of a beautiful heron:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CRIES OF THE BIRDS.</i></div>

<p>“I immediately stood still,” he says; “the upright
and motionless attitude of the bird indicated plainly
that he had been taken by surprise; and for the
moment he seemed, as it were, stunned, and incapable
of flight. There he remained, as if fastened to the
spot, his bright yellow eye staring me full in the
face, and with an expression that seemed to inquire
what right I had to intrude into solitudes where the
human form is so rarely seen. As we were thus
gazing at each other, in mutual surprise at having
met in such a place, I observed his long slender neck
quietly and gradually doubling down upon his breast.
His dark and lengthened plumes were at the same time
slightly shaken. I knew by this that he was about to
rise; another moment, and he was up. Stretching
his long legs behind him, he uttered a scream so
dismal, wild, and loud, that the very glen and hills
re-echoed the sound, and the whole scene was instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
filled with clamour. The sandpiper screamed
its <i>kittie-needie</i>; the pigeon <i>cooed</i>; the pipit, with
lively emotion, came flying round me, uttering all
the while its <i>peeping</i> note; the moor-cock sprang
with whirring wing from his heathy lair, and gave
forth his well-known and indignant <i>birr birr-bick</i>;
the curlew came sailing down the glen with steady
flight, and added to the noise with his shrill and
peculiar notes of <i>poo-elie poo-elie coorlie coorlie wha-up</i>;
and, from the loftier parts of the hills, the plovers
ceased not their mournful wail, which accorded so well
with the scene of which I alone appeared to be a
silent spectator. But I moved not a foot until the
alarmed inmates of the glen and the mountain had
disappeared, and solemn stillness had again resumed
its sway.”</p>

<p>On the following day, while crossing the Clashmauch,
on his way to Huntly, Edward observed a
curlew rise from a marshy part of the hill, to which
he bent his steps in hopes of finding her nest. In
this, however, he was disappointed; but, in searching
about, and within a few feet of the remains of a
wreath of snow, he came upon a wild duck lying
beside a tuft of rushes. It may be mentioned that
there had been a heavy snowstorm which had forced
the plovers and wild ducks to abandon their nests,
though then full of eggs, and greatly interrupted the
breeding season in the northern counties. Edward
proceeds:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MOTHERLY WILD DUCK.</i></div>

<p>“As I imagined she was skulking with a view to
avoid observation, I touched her with my stick, in
order that she might rise; but she rose not. I was
surprised, and, on a nearer inspection, I found that
she was dead. She lay raised a little on one side,
her neck stretched out, her mouth open and full of
snow, her wings somewhat extended, and with one of
her legs appearing a little behind her. Near to it
there were two eggs. On my discovering this I lifted
up the bird, and underneath her was a nest containing
eleven eggs; these, with the other two, made
thirteen in all; a few of them were broken. I examined
the whole of them, and found them, without
exception, to contain young birds. This was an undoubted
proof that the poor mother had sat upon them
from two to three weeks. With her dead body in my
hand I sat down to investigate the matter, and to
ascertain, if I could, the cause of her death. I examined
her minutely all over, and could find neither
wound nor any mark whatever of violence. She had
every appearance of having died of suffocation. Although
I had only circumstantial evidence, I had no
hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that she had
come by her death in a desperate but faithful struggle
to protect her eggs from the fatal effects of the recent
snowstorm.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BURIES THE WILD DUCK.</i></div>

<p>“I could not help thinking, as I looked at her,
how deep and striking an example she afforded of
maternal affection. The ruthless blast had swept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with all its fury, along the lonesome and unsheltered
hill. The snow had risen higher, and the smothering
drift came fiercer, as night drew on; yet still that
poor bird, in defiance of the warring elements, continued
to protect her home, and the treasure which it
contained, until she could do so no longer, and yielded
up her life. That life she could easily have saved,
had she been willing to abandon the offspring which
Nature had taught her so fervently to cherish, and in
endeavouring to preserve which she voluntarily remained
and died. Occupied with such feelings and reflections
as these, I know not how long I might have sat,
had I not been roused from my reverie by the barking
of a shepherd’s dog. The sun had already set,—the
grey twilight had begun to hide the distant mountains
from my sight, and, not caring to be benighted
on such a spot, I wrapped a piece of paper, as a winding
sheet, round the faithful and devoted bird, and,
forming a hole sufficiently large for the purpose, I
laid into it the mother and the eggs. I covered them
with earth and moss, and, over all, placed a solid
piece of turf; and having done so,—and being more
affected than I should perhaps be willing to acknowledge,—I
left them to moulder into their original dust,
and went on my way.”</p>

<p>Having thus related an instance of maternal affection
on the part of the wild duck, let us cite a still
more remarkable instance of brotherly sympathy and
help on the part of the common Tern (<i>Sterna hirundo</i>),
called Pickietars in the neighbourhood of Banff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PICKIETARS.</i></div>

<p>“Being on the sands of Boyndie one afternoon at
the end of August, I observed several parties of
Pickietars busily employed in fishing in the firth.
As I was in want of a specimen of this bird, I loitered
about on the beach, narrowly watching their motions,
and hoping that some of them would come within
range of my gun. The scene around was of no common
beauty. In the azure heaven, not a cloud was
to be seen as far as the eye could reach; not a breath
of wind was stirring the placid bosom of the firth.
The atmosphere seemed a sea, as it were, of living
things; so numerous were the insects that hummed
and fluttered to and fro in all directions. The sun,
approaching the verge of the horizon, shot long and
glimmering bands of green and gold across the broad
mirror of the deep. Here and there several vessels
were lying becalmed, their whitened sails showing
brightly in the goldened light. An additional interest
was imparted by the herring-boats which were congregating
in the bay; their loose and flagging sails,
the noise of the oars, and the efforts of the rowers,
told plainly enough that a hard pull would have to
be undergone, before they could reach their particular
quarters for fishing, in the north-eastern part of
the firth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PICKIETAR FISHING.</i></div>

<p>“While I stood surveying with delight the extended
and glorious prospect, and witnessing with
admiration the indefatigable evolutions of the Terns in
their search for food, I observed one of them break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
off from a party of five, and direct his course towards
the shore, fishing all the way as he came. It was an
interesting sight to behold him as he approached in
his flight,—at one moment rising, at another descending,—now
poised in mid-air, his wings expanded
but motionless, his piercing eye directed to the
waters beneath, and watching with eager gaze the
movements of their scaly inhabitants,—and now, as
one of them would ever and anon come sufficiently
near the surface, making his attack upon the fish
in the manner so thoroughly taught him by nature.
Quick as thought he closed to his side his outspread
pinions; turned off his equilibrium with a movement
almost imperceptible; and, with a seeming carelessness,
threw himself headlong into the deep so
rapidly that the eye could with difficulty keep
pace with his descent. In the least space of time he
would be seen sitting on the water, swallowing his
prey. This being accomplished, he again mounted
into the air. He halts in his progress. Something
has caught his eye. He lets himself down; but
it is only for a little, for his expected prey has
vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>“Once more he soars aloft on lively wing; and
having attained a certain elevation, and hovering
kestrel-like for a little with quick repeated strokes of
his pinions, he rapidly descends. Again, however,
his hoped-for victim has made its escape; and he
bounds away in an oblique direction, describing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
beautiful curve as he rises without having touched
the water. Shortly after, he wings his way nearer and
nearer to the beach: onwards he advances with zigzag
flight, when suddenly, as if struck down by an
unseen hand, he drops into the water within about
thirty yards of the place where I was standing. As
he righted and sat on the bosom of the deep, I was
enabled distinctly to perceive that he held in his bill
a little scaly captive which he had snatched from its
home, and which struggled violently to regain its
liberty. Its struggles were in vain: a few squeezes
from the mandibles of the bird put an end to its
existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PICKIETAR SHOT.</i></div>

<p>“Being now within my reach, I stood prepared
for the moment when he should again arise. This he
did so soon as the fish was despatched. I fired, and
he came down with a broken wing, screaming as he
fell into the water. The report of the gun, together
with his cries, brought together the party he had left,
in order that they might ascertain the cause of the
alarm. After surveying their wounded brother round
and round, as he was drifting unwittingly toward the
shore with the flowing tide, they came flying in a
body to the spot where I stood, and rent the air with
their screams. These they continued to utter, regardless
of their own individual safety, until I began
to make preparations for receiving the approaching
bird. I could already see that it was a beautiful
adult specimen; and I expected in a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to have it in my possession, being not very far from
the water’s edge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WOUNDED PICKIETAR RESCUED.</i></div>

<p>“While matters were in this position, I beheld to
my utter astonishment and surprise, two of the unwounded
Terns take hold of their disabled comrade,
one at each wing, lift him out of the water, and bear
him out seawards. They were followed by two other
birds. After being carried about six or seven yards,
he was let gently down again, when he was taken
up in a similar manner by the two who had been
hitherto inactive. In this way they continued to
carry him alternately, until they had conveyed him
to a rock at a considerable distance, upon which they
landed him in safety. Having recovered my self-possession,
I made toward the rock, wishing to
obtain the prize which had been so unceremoniously
snatched from my grasp. I was observed, however, by
the Terns; and instead of four, I had in a short time
a whole swarm about me. On my near approach to
the rock, I once more beheld two of them take hold
of the wounded bird as they had done already, and
bear him out to sea in triumph, far beyond my
reach. This, had I been so inclined, I could no doubt
have prevented. Under the circumstances, however,
my feelings would not permit me; and I willingly
allowed them to perform without molestation
an act of mercy, and to exhibit an instance of affection,
which man himself need not be ashamed to
imitate. I was, indeed, rejoiced at the disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
which they had occasioned, for they had thereby
rendered me the witness of a scene which I could
scarcely have believed, and which no length of time
will efface from my recollection.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLOSENESS OF OBSERVATION.</i></div>

<p>On another occasion, Edward exhibited the same
closeness, minuteness, and patience of observation,
with regard to the Turnstone (<i>Strepsilas interpres</i>), a
bird which is an inhabitant of the sea-shore, and has
a wide geographical range, though it has rarely been
seen on the shores of the Moray Firth. In Edward’s
ornithological excursions, it was not so much his
object to kill birds as to observe their manners and
habits. He very often made his excursions without
a gun at all. In a letter to the author, he observes—“In
looking over my printed articles, you will find
a great number of notices of the habits and workings
of various species. I spent so much time in observation,
that I had little time to spare to write out the
results. And what I did write, did not seem to be
much appreciated. Perhaps this is not to be wondered
at. It appears that the compilers of works on
Natural History in this country do not care for details
of the habits of the animals they treat of. They rather
glory in the abundance of technical descriptions they
can supply. These may seem scientific, but they are at
the same time very dry. In fact, Natural History is
rendered detestable to general readers. We want some
writers of the Audubon and Wilson class to render
Natural History accessible to the public at large.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TURNSTONE.</i></div>

<p>If Edward himself could have been rescued
from his shoemaker’s seat, we might probably
have had the book which he indicates. He was
full of love for his subject; he was patient and
persevering in his observations; and, notwithstanding
his great disadvantages, it will be observed
that his style of writing was vivid and graphic.
With respect to the Turnstone, which Edward
described in 1850,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> it does not appear that any
ornithological writer, excepting Audubon, had particularly
described it; although Edward had never
read Audubon’s work. The Reverend Mr. Smith
observed—“It is consistent with my knowledge
that Mr. Edward has never read the account
given by Audubon of the habits of the Turnstone.
I mention this as a proof, amongst others, of the
accuracy and minuteness with which he makes his
observations. He is the only European, so far as
I have the means of ascertaining, who has described
the efforts which are put forth by the bird in question
in cases of difficulty, not only with its bill, but with
its breast also.” The following is Edward’s description
of the bird:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESCRIPTION OF TURNSTONE.</i></div>

<p>“The Turnstone is a very interesting bird, from its
peculiar form and singular habits. It is a strong
thick bird, with rather short thick legs, long expanded
toes, and full broad breast. Its bill is in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
an elongated cone, strong at the base, on the culmen
rather flattened, and with a curve inclining upwards
towards the tip. The habits of the bird are singular,
more particularly with respect to the method which
it adopts to procure food,—which is, as its name
denotes, by turning over small stones in search of
the insects beneath them, on which it feeds. When
the object which it wishes to turn over is too large
for the bill to do so, the breast is applied; and it
would seem that the birds are willing to assist each
other, just as masons or porters will do in turning
over a stone or a bale of goods. I may here take
the liberty of mentioning an incident concerning the
Turnstone which came under my own observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OBSERVATION OF THE TURNSTONE.</i></div>

<p>“Passing along the sea-shore to the west of Banff,
I observed on the sands, at a considerable distance
before me, two birds beside a large-looking object.
Knowing by their appearance, that they did not belong
to the species which are usually met with in this
quarter, I left the beach and proceeded along the
adjoining links, an eminence of shingle intervening,
until I concluded that I was almost opposite to the
spot where the objects of my search were employed.
Stooping down, and with my gun upon my back prepared
for action, I managed to crawl through the
bents and across the shingle for a considerable way.
At length I came in sight of the two little workers,
who were busily endeavouring to turn over a dead
fish which was fully six times their size. I immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
recognised them as Turnstones. Not wishing
to disturb them, and anxious at the same time to
witness their operations, I observed that a few paces
nearer them, there was a deep hollow among the
shingle, where I contrived to creep into unobserved.</p>

<p>“I was now distant from them about ten yards,
and had a distinct and unobstructed view of all their
movements. In these there was evinced that extraordinary
degree of sagacity and perseverance which
comes under the notice only of those who watch the
habits of the lower creation with patience and assiduity,
and which, when fully and accurately related,
is not unfrequently discredited by individuals who,
although fond of Natural History, seem inclined to
believe that everything in regard to animals must
necessarily be false, or at least the result of ignorance,
unless it has been recorded in books which are considered
authorities on the subject.</p>

<p>“But to return: having got fairly settled down in
my pebbly observatory, I turned my undivided attention
to the birds before me. They were boldly
pushing at the fish with their bills, and then with
their breasts. Their endeavours, however, were in
vain: the object remained immovable. On this they
both went round to the opposite side, and began to
scrape away the sand from beneath the fish. After
removing a considerable quantity, they again came
back to the spot which they had left, and went once
more to work with their bills and breasts, but with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
little apparent success as formerly. Nothing daunted,
however, they ran round a second time to the other
side, and recommenced their trenching operations with
a seeming determination not to be baffled in their
object, which evidently was to undermine the dead
animal before them, in order that it might be the
more easily overturned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOINED BY A BROTHER TURNSTONE.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TURN OVER THE COD.</i></div>

<p>“While they were thus employed, and after they
had laboured in this manner at both sides alternately
for nearly half-an-hour, they were joined by another
of their own species, which came flying with rapidity
from the neighbouring rocks. Its timely arrival was
hailed with evident signs of joy. I was led to this
conclusion from the gestures which they exhibited,
and from a low but pleasant murmuring noise to
which they gave utterance so soon as the new-comer
made his appearance. Of their feelings he seemed to
be perfectly aware, and he made his reply to them in
a similar strain. Their mutual congratulations being
over, they all three set to work; and after labouring
vigorously for a few minutes in removing the sand,
they came round to the other side, and putting their
breasts simultaneously to the fish, they succeeded in
raising it some inches from the sand, but were unable
to turn it over. It went down again into its sandy
bed, to the manifest disappointment of the three.
Resting, however, for a space, and without leaving
their respective positions, which were a little apart
the one from the other, they resolved, it appears, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
give the work another trial. Lowering themselves,
with their breasts close to the sand, they managed to
push their bills underneath the fish, which they made
to rise to about the same height as before. Afterwards,
withdrawing their bills, but without losing the
advantage which they had gained, they applied their
breasts to the object. This they did with such force
and to such purpose, that at length it went over, and
rolled several yards down a slight declivity. It was
followed to some distance by the birds themselves,
before they could recover their bearing.</p>

<p>“They returned eagerly to the spot from whence
they had dislodged the obstacle which had so long
opposed them; and they gave unmistakable proof,
by their rapid and continued movements, that they
were enjoying an ample repast as the reward of their
industrious and praiseworthy labour. I was so pleased,
and even delighted, with the sagacity and perseverance
which they had shown, that I should have
considered myself as guilty of a crime had I endeavoured
to take away the lives of these interesting
beings, at the very moment when they were exercising,
in a manner so happily for themselves,
the wonderful instincts implanted in them by their
Creator. When they appeared to have done and to
be satisfied, I arose from my place of concealment.
On examining the fish, I found it to be a specimen
of the common cod. It was nearly three feet and a
half long, and it had been imbedded in the sand to
the depth of about two inches.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Edward’s greatest pleasures was in rambling
along the sea-shore, to observe the habits of the sea
birds. The multitude of birds which frequent the
shores of the Moray Firth are occasioned by the
shoals of herrings, which afford food not only for
thousands of fishermen but for millions of sea-birds.
To show the number of birds that frequent the coast,
it may be mentioned that during the storm that occurred
in December 1846, Edward counted between
the Burn of Boyne and Greenside of Gamrie, a distance
of about nine miles, nearly sixty of the Little
Auk, which had been driven ashore dead, besides a
large number of Guillemots and Razorbills. Numbers
of these birds were also found lying dead in
the fields throughout the county.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LITTLE AUK.</i></div>

<p>And yet the Little Auk has a wonderful power of
resisting the fury of the waves. “It is a grand sight,”
says Edward, “to see one of these diminutive but intrepid
creatures manœuvring with the impetuous billows
of a stormy sea. Wave follows wave in rapid
succession, bearing destruction to everything within
reach; but the Little Auk, taught by Nature, avoids
the threatened danger, either by mounting above the
waves or by going beneath them, reappearing unhurt
as they spend their fury on the shore. The
eye for a time wanders in vain amongst the turbulent
surge, to catch another sight of the little sailor
bird. One unaccustomed to such a scene would be
apt to exclaim ‘Poor little thing! It is buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
amidst the foam!’ Have a little patience. See,
there it is, once more, as lively as ever, and ready
to master the approaching billow. Its descent
amongst the waves may have been merely in search
of food, for it is only betwixt the waves, whilst inshore
during a storm, that the bird can descend for
that purpose. The bird is known in our locality by
the curious term of the ‘Nor-a-wa-wifie,’ from the
supposition that it comes from Norway.”</p>

<p>The rocky coasts along the east shore were the
most attractive scenes for our Naturalist. Not only
the wildest scenery, but the wildest birds, were to be
found in that quarter. Gamrie Mohr and Troup
Head were especially favourite places. We have
already described Edward’s adventures near the
former headland. Here is his description of his
visit to Troup Head:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SEA-FOWL NURSERIES.</i></div>

<p>“Sailing in a little bark, with a gentle breeze
blowing, I had ample opportunities of viewing the
various birds as they approached, and as they
flew past. Passing in front of the several sea-fowl
nurseries of Troup, I beheld scenes truly magnificent—scenes
which could not have failed to create feelings
of the deepest interest in a mind capable of
appreciating the sublime and beautiful workings of
Nature. Having landed at the most famed of these
nurseries, in order to view the scene with advantage—here,
I thought, as I gazed at the white towering
cliffs which had laughed to scorn the angriest scowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the most mighty wave that ever spent its fury
at their base, and defied the stormiest blast from
the icy North; where the largest gull in its midway
flight appears no larger than the smallest of its kind;
where the falcon breeds beside and in perfect harmony
with the other inhabitants of the rocky cliffs; where
multitudes of birds, of various forms and hues, from
the snowy whiteness of the Kittiwake to the sable
dye of the croaking raven, have found a resting-place
whereon to build their nests and deposit their young;—here,
I thought, as I was about to leave the busy
throng—even here, man, the noblest creature, though
too often degrading himself beneath the lowest of
animals, might learn lessons of industry and affection
from these humble monitors of Nature.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PENNAN.</i></div>

<p>During breeding-time the clamour of the sea-birds
is tumultuous, though the lashing of the sea at the
foot of the cliffs tends to a great extent to lull their
noise. But towards evening all becomes still again.
Edward frequently ascertained this by personal experience.
Being in the neighbourhood of Pennan
one day, he went along the Head, in order, if possible,
to get a sight of the far-famed eagles of the promontory.
He was unsuccessful on the occasion. He
had loitered by the way, and the declining day at
length warned him to leave the place without seeing
the coveted sight. His road westward lay along the
coast. With disappointed hopes he trudged along,
scarcely thinking how the hours were flying. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
length it became dark as he approached the broom
braes of Troup. He found himself fairly benighted.
At the same time he was tired and weary. He had
endured many outs and ins, ups and downs, that day.
His intention was to have gone to the house of his
old shopmate at Gardenstown, and spend the night.
But now he felt, from his worn-out condition, that
it would have taken him nearly two hours’ walking
to reach the place. He therefore determined to stay
where he was, or rather, to go down to a sleeping-place
near Troup Head, to ascertain how his feathered
friends conducted themselves during the night time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SLEEPS IN HELL’S LUM.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SEA-BIRDS AT NIGHT.</i></div>

<p>His sleeping place was a very wild one. It was
no other than Hell’s Lum. He knew the place well.
He had entered it both from the sea-side and from the
land-side. He had been in it in storm and calm,
in clouds and sunshine. And now he was about to
spend the night in it. The weather was, however,
calm; the sea was like a sheet of glass; so that
he had little fear of getting a wetting during his few
hours’ stay. While in the “Lum,” he was at the back
of the cliffs, and in close proximity with the breeding
places of the myriads of sea-fowl. It was now the
busiest part of the season. The birds had been very
clamorous during the day, but as night came on, their
clamour ceased. With the exception of a few screams,—while,
perhaps, the birds were being displaced in
their nests,—the night was silent, though Edward
kept awake and listened for nearly the whole time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>But with the first glimmerings of daylight, and
just as he was beginning to move and to creep out of
the pit, Edward thought that he heard some of the
birds beginning to whimper and yawn, as if ready for
another day’s work; and by the time he had rounded
Crovie Head, he beheld the cliffs alive, and the multitude
of sea-birds again in full operation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small><i>LITERATURE AND CORRESPONDENCE.</i></small></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>THE REV. MR. SMITH.</i></div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A great</span> misfortune befell Edward in 1854: his
friend the Rev. Mr. Smith died. He was a man
whose richly cultivated mind and warm heart endeared
him to all with whom he came in contact. He
was almost the only man of culture in the neighbourhood
who appreciated the character of Edward.
He not only made himself his friend, but became his
helper. Edward was under the impression that
people looked down upon him and his work, because
he was a poor shoemaker. There were other persons
who knew of Edward’s perseverance, self-denial, and
uncomplainingness, and also of his efforts to rise into
a higher life. But they did not help him as Mr.
Smith did. The true Christian gentleman treated
the poor man as his friend. He treated him as one
intelligent man treats another. The shoemaker from
Banff was always made welcome at the minister’s
fireside at Monquhitter.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith helped Edward with books. He lent
him such books as he had, from his own library; and
he borrowed books from others, in order to satisfy
Edward’s inquiries about objects in Natural History.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>He wandered about the fields with him, admiring his
close observation; and he urged him to note down
the facts which he observed, in order that they might
be published to the world.</p>

<p>In one of the last letters addressed by Mr. Smith
to Edward he observed: “It is, I conceive, the great
defect in the natural sciences that we know so little
of the real habits and instincts of the animal creation.
In helping to fill up this gap, your personal minute
and accurate observations will be of no little service;
although individuals, solemn and wise in their own
conceit, may look upon some of them as so strange
as to be altogether fabulous; and <i>that</i> for no better
reason than because during all their lives,—having
exercised their faculties only in eating, drinking, and
sleeping,—the things related have never come under
the notice either of their eyes or their ears.”</p>

<p>We find, from a letter of Professor Dickie, that
Mr. Smith endeavoured to obtain employment for
Edward as a preserver of British birds for the Natural
History collection in King’s College, Aberdeen. Many
kindly letters passed between Edward and the
minister of Monquhitter, sometimes about newly-discovered
birds; at other times about the troubles and
sicknesses of their respective families. Mr. Smith’s
suggestion that Edward should note down his observations
for publication was not, as we have seen,
without effect, as the latter afterwards became a contributor
to the <i>Naturalist</i>, the <i>Zoologist</i>, the <i>Ibis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the <i>Linnæan Journal</i>, and other Natural History

<p>In one of Edward’s articles in the <i>Zoologist</i>, he
thus refers to a circumstance which happened during
one of the last excursions he took with his reverend
friend. He is referring to the partridge (<i>Perdrix
cinerea</i>). “A very cunning and faithful mother is
the female; for when she has eggs, she never leaves
her nest without hiding them so carefully that it is
almost impossible to detect their whereabouts; and
if you take her by surprise, away she hobbles on one
leg, and a wing trailing on the ground, as if wounded!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Wandering about the Waggle Hill one day with
my friend the Rev. Mr. Smith, I chanced to observe
a moor-fowl squatted on the ground amongst the
heather, close to my feet; in fact, I stood above her
before I noticed her. Being summer time, I at once
guessed the nature of the case. On my friend coming
up, I drew his attention to the bird over which I
stood. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘she’s surely dead, Mr.
Edward.’ ‘Oh, no,’ said I; ‘there are eggs or young
beneath her.’ ‘Well,’ he answered, ‘if so, it is
certainly a very wonderful circumstance, but we shall
see.’ Then, stooping down, he touched the bird,
but she did not move. ‘She must be alive,’ he said,
‘because she is warm; but she must be wounded,
and not able to rise or fly.’ ‘Oh, no,’ I once more
said; ‘she has something beneath her which she is
unwilling to leave.’ The bird allowed him to stroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
her without moving, except turning her head to look
at him. On my friend’s dog Sancho coming up and
putting his nose close to her, she crept away
through the bushes for some distance, and then took
to flight, leaving a nest and fifteen eggs exposed to
our gaze. Before leaving, we carefully closed up the
heather again, so as to conceal as much as possible
the nest and its beauteous treasure; and I need not
say that we were both delighted with what we had
seen. Mr. Smith was particularly struck with the
incident, as he had never seen anything of the kind
before; and he remarked, ‘I verily believe that I
could not have credited the fact if I had not seen it
myself,’ and he afterwards spoke of it with the
greatest admiration.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LOCH OF STRATHBEG.</i></div>

<p>Edward also numbered among his friends the
Rev. Alexander Boyd of Crimond. It was through
the Rev. Mr. Smith that Edward was first introduced
to him. Mr. Smith was anxious that Edward should
examine and observe the birds of Strathbeg, near
which the village of Crimond is situated. Crimond
is about thirty-five miles from Banff, ten miles from
Peterhead, and about seven from Fraserburgh.</p>

<p>The loch of Strathbeg was at one time of limited
extent. It was connected with the sea at its eastern
extremity; but a hill of sand having, about the beginning
of last century, been blown across the opening
during a furious east wind, the connection
between the loch and the sea was closed, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
became a fresh-water loch, as it remains to this day.
The scenery in the neighbourhood is by no means
picturesque; but the loch is very attractive to sportsmen,
in consequence of the number of wildfowl that
frequent it, or which breed among the islands and
marshes at its western extremity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE REV. MR. BOYD.</i></div>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Boyd was the parish minister of
Crimond. His hospitable manse was always open to
Edward when he visited the neighbourhood. In one
of Mr. Boyd’s letters to Edward, he said, “We have
exactly the sort of room that will suit you, and
you will be left at liberty to pursue your researches
at your convenience; the room being so
situated that you can go out or come in at any hour
of the day or night, without any one being the wiser.
There will always be something in the cupboard to
refresh you before starting at daybreak, or when you
come home at night, though every one in the house
may be asleep. And you may continue with us the
whole week, if you be so disposed. My coble will
always be at your service, and I hope to be able to
accompany you on some of your rambles, though I
am not nearly so agile now as I have been.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs.
Boyd is now quite well, though she had a long illness
after you were here;—and we have a young
specimen of zoology to show you, which is worth all
the rare birds of Strathbeg put together!”</p>

<p>The number of water-fowl that Edward found
about the loch was very great. During winter time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was the haunt of birds from far and near, in prodigious
numbers. In summer time it was the breeding-place
of numerous birds of a different kind. The
people of the neighbourhood say that “all the birds
of the world come here in winter.” In angry weather,
when the ocean is tempest-tossed, the sea-birds fly
in, and, mingling with the natives, constitute a very
motley group. The number of birds is so great that
when a gun is fired they rise <i>en masse</i>, and literally
darken the air, whilst their noise is perfectly deafening.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BIRDS AT STRATHBEG.</i></div>

<p>The swans are among the largest birds that frequent
the loch. Edward found the beautiful White Hooper
(<i>Cygnus ferus</i>), and the no less fair and elegant Polish
Swan (<i>Cygnus immutabilis</i>). The geese were innumerable:
the Bean Goose (<i>Anser segetum</i>), the
Pink-footed Goose (<i>A. brachyrynchus</i>), the White-pointed
Goose (<i>A. erythropus</i>), the Barnacle Goose (<i>A.
leucopsis</i>), the Brent Goose (<i>A. brenta</i>), the Canadian
Goose (<i>A. Canadensis</i>), and even the Egyptian Goose
(<i>A. Egyptiacus</i>). The last mentioned was first
detected by Mr. Boyd himself. In a letter to Edward,
dated the 24th November 1853, he said—“One
morning lately I was informed that there was a strange
bird of the goose tribe in my mill-dam. I sallied
forth with a telescope in one hand and a double-barrel,
loaded with No. 1, in the other. I first took
a leisurely look at him with the former at less than
100 yards distance, when I made the following observations:—Size
and appearance that of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
wild goose; Head, brown and grey mixed; Back,
rich brown, lightish; Breast and neck, grey; Tail,
dark or black; Tips of Wings, ditto, and glossy;
Legs and Bill, reddish; a dark ring round the neck,
and a dark spot right on the centre of the breast.
He was nibbling the tender grass on the dam banks.
I then approached nearer. Instead of flying, he
merely swam away to the other side of the pond, and
seemed either very tired or else accustomed to the
presence of man. I was quite within shot of him,
but, from his tameness, I conjectured that he was
some fancy animal escaped from a gentleman’s
demesne. I then went for some corn, and scattered
it on the banks, and as soon as I moved away he
came to eat it. When startled, he generally makes
a circuit of a quarter of a mile and returns again;
but latterly he goes to the loch of Strathbeg all night
and returns in the morning for his corn. I am
afraid he will not be spared long, although I have
sent word in several directions that he is not to be
shot. I should be glad if he would become domesticated.
I wish you would look over some of your
books and tell me what he is. I have not seen a
bird of the same kind before.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EGYPTIAN GOOSE.</i></div>

<p>From Mr. Boyd’s minute description of the bird,
Edward was enabled to inform him that it could be
nothing else than a specimen of that rare species, the
Egyptian Goose. After about two months’ sojourn
in Mr. Boyd’s mill-pond, the bird flew away on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
day preceding the great snow-storm of January
1854, and never returned. Mr. Boyd was afterwards
enabled to ascertain the correctness of Edward’s information.
He was in Liverpool, and while visiting a
poulterer’s yard, he observed a bird exactly like the
one that had taken shelter in his mill-pond. On
inquiring its name, he was informed that it was an
Egyptian Goose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WINTER BIRDS.</i></div>

<p>The Mallard, the Widgeon, the Teal, the Garganey,
the Pintail, the Ferruginous, the Harlequin,
the Shoveler, the Shieldrake, and the Eider Duck,
visit the loch occasionally in winter. The ducks
were ten times more numerous than the geese. There
were the Scaup (<i>Fuligula marila</i>), the Tufted (<i>F.
cristata</i>), the Red-headed Pochard or Dunbird (<i>F.
ferina</i>), and the Golden-eyed Garrot (<i>Clangula garrotta</i>).
The Red-necked Grebe and the Black-chinned
Grebe also bred in the loch. Herons,
Bitterns, Spoon-bills, Glossy Ibises, Snipes, Woodcocks,
Green Sandpipers, Ruffs, Dotterels, Gray
Phalaropes, were also to be seen. These were the
birds that mostly frequented the loch in winter.
There were numerous flocks of Gulls of various
species, and other shore-birds, which only made
visits to the loch for shelter during storms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RING DOTTEREL.</i></div>

<p>When spring approached the birds became restless.
The flocks began to break up, and flights of
birds disappeared daily. At length the greater part
of the winter birds left, except a few stragglers. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
entirely different set of birds now began to make their
appearance. You could now hear the shrill whistle
of the Redshank, the bright carol of the Lark, the
wire-like call of the Dunlin, the melancholy note of
the Wagtail, the boom of the Snipe, and the pleasant
peewit of the Lapwing. There were also the Black-headed
Bunting, the Ring Dotterel, the Wheatear, the
Meadow Pipit, the Reed Warbler, the Rose Linnet, the
Twite, the Red-shank, the Black-headed Gull, and the
Arctic Tern, which bred in suitable localities round
the loch. Among the remaining birds, were several
specimens of the Skua, Coots, Water-hens, Swifts, and
several kinds of Swallows. The Whimbrel, Greenshank,
Water-Rail, Pied Wagtail, Roseate Tern, and
Water Ouzel, also frequented the neighbourhood of
the loch, but did not breed there.</p>

<p>In an account of “The Birds of Strathbeg,” which
Edward afterwards published in the <i>Naturalist</i>, he
mentioned the curious manner in which the Ring
Dotterel contrives to divert attention from her nest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PURSUIT.</i></div>

<p>While strolling along the sands in the month of
July, a friend who was with him fired at a Tern.
Without knowing what he had fired at, Edward saw
a Ring Dotterel before him, which, he thought, must
be the bird. It was lame, and dragging its wing
behind it as if it had been sorely wounded. It lay
down, as if dead. Edward came up, and put his
hand down to secure it. The bird rose and flew
away. Then it dropped again, hobbled and tottered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
about, as if inviting him to pursue it:—“I stood a
few seconds,” says Edward, “considering whether I
would follow or not; then off I started, determined
to have it. Away went the bird, twiddling and
straddling, and away I followed in hot pursuit.
Round and round the sand hillocks we scrambled
until I was perfectly wearied. Nothing but the
novelty of the affair could have kept me in pursuit of
the wounded bird.</p>

<p>“In this way we continued, until I saw that I
could make nothing of it by fair means; so I doubled
round and met it fair in front. I was about to take
hold of it, when, to my amazement, it rose and flew.
Its flight, however, was of short duration, as it again
suddenly dropped down, and lay on the sand as if
dead. ‘You are mine now at last,’ said I, as I observed
it fall. I accordingly proceeded to take it up,
in order to put it in my pocket. But lo, it rose
again and flew away; when once more it suddenly
dropped behind one of the larger hillocks. It was
a beautifully-marked specimen, and, fearing lest I
should lose it altogether, I determined to put a stop
to the wild-goose chase. Having put my gun in
readiness, I proceeded in the direction in which the
bird fell. But it did not rise. I searched all round,
but there was no bird! I met my friend, and inquired
if he had fired at a Ring Dotterel. No, he had only
shot at a Tern. ‘But, by the by,’ he added, ‘I found
a nest and the young of that bird as I came along.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PURSUIT DEFEATED.</i></div>

<p>“In a few minutes we stood beside the young ones.
The spot I found to be only about three yards in
advance of where my attention was first attracted to
the apparently wounded bird. Having collected the
little downy things, and placed them in a hollow
among the sand, we again took our departure. In
doing so, what should we meet but my old friend the
Dotterel, which again commenced its former pranks!
But no! It was too late; the truth had oozed out.
The bird had completely deceived me, and my friend
laughed heartily at my mistake.”</p>

<p>During one of Edward’s visits to Crimond Manse,
to which some gentlemen of the neighbourhood had
been invited to meet him, Mr. Boyd, after dinner, when
the ladies had left the room, expressed his surprise
that something had not been done to enable Edward
to obtain more time to pursue his researches in
Natural History. The gentlemen present cordially
agreed with him. Mr. Boyd then proposed to insert
a notice in the <i>Fraserburgh Advertiser</i>, and to circulate
it extensively in the neighbourhood. The following
forms part of the article:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. BOYD’S PROPOSAL.</i></div>

<p>“During the past month our district has been
visited by Mr. Edward from Banff, a Naturalist of no
mean attainments, and one who, we doubt not, will
soon bring himself into public notice, both by his
indefatigable researches into Natural Science, and his
valuable contributions to various scientific periodicals.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
While there are few branches of Natural History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in which he does not take an interest, it is in
Ornithology that he shines most conspicuously, and in
this he was much encouraged by the late Rev. Mr.
Smith of Monquhitter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We cordially wish
Mr. Edward every success in the various fields of
research upon which he has entered. It is but justice
to a most deserving person to draw attention to
his praiseworthy endeavours, in the midst of many
difficulties, to perfect his knowledge of Natural
History, and to recommend it to all around him,
especially the young. Happy would it be, if our
tradesmen were to take a leaf out of Mr. Edward’s
book, and instead of wasting their time, squandering
their means, and embittering their existence in
the haunts of dissipation, they would sally forth in
these calm summer evenings to rural scenes and
sylvan solitudes, to woo Nature in her mildest aspect—to
learn a lesson from the moth or the spider—to
listen to the hum of the bee or the song of birds—to
mark the various habits and instincts of animals,
and thus to enrich their minds with useful and entertaining
knowledge.”</p>

<p>Mr. Boyd’s object in publishing this notice was to
attract the attention of the working classes to the study
of Natural History; and with this object he was of
opinion that Edward should endeavour to disseminate
amongst them the information which he had acquired
during his long experience. He proposed that Edward
should get up a series of rudimentary lectures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Natural History, illustrated by specimens of birds and
other objects. The lectures were first to be delivered
in Banff, and if they succeeded there, they were afterwards
to be delivered in Fraserburgh and other
towns. Edward proceeded to prepare his illustrations.
About 200 were put in readiness. He was also
negotiating for the purchase of a powerful magnifying
glass, so that his patrons might better see the minute
wonders of Nature as exhibited in her works.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NATIVE GENIUS.</i></div>

<p>As there was then an institution at Banff, which
had been formed, amongst other purposes, “For the
Discovery and Encouragement of Native Genius and
Talent,” Mr. Boyd believed that the members would
at once give their hearty co-operation to his proposed
scheme. He proposed the formation of a local committee,
in order that the rudimentary lectures might
be brought out under their patronage. Edward was
requested to name some gentlemen in Banff with
whom Mr. Boyd might communicate on the subject.
This was a poser; for Edward knew only a few hard-working
men like himself. Nevertheless, he did
give the name of a gentleman, who, he thought,
might give his assistance. When the gentleman was
applied to, he politely declined. Edward was asked
to name another. He named another, and he also
declined. Thus the proposal, from which Mr. Boyd
had expected so much, fell to the ground, and it was
no more heard of.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF MR. BOYD.</i></div>

<p>Shortly after this event, Mr. Boyd died suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Edward thus refers to the event:—“It was but
yesterday, at noon,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that my friend the Rev. Mr.
Boyd of Crimond,—while full of life and strength,
and with every prospect of enjoying many, many
long years to come,—left his young and courteous
partner and two blooming little ones, to
enjoy a short walk with a neighbouring gentleman.
Alas! short was the walk indeed, and, woe is me!
never to return. A few paces, and he dropped down
and almost instantly expired. Alas! another of my
best friends gone. Cruel death! if thy hand continues
to strip me thus, thou wilt soon, very soon, leave me
desolate; and then who will take notice of the poor
Naturalist? Well may the parish of Crimond say,
‘We have lost that which we may never again find.’
Well might Mercy weep, and Religion mourn his
premature departure, for in him they have lost
a friend on earth; and I, alas! a friend too, and a
benefactor.”</p>

<p>Edward completed his article on “The Birds of
Strathbeg” only two days after Mr. Boyd’s death.
It had been written out at his instance, and was
afterwards published in the <i>Naturalist</i>. It was one
of the first papers to which Edward subscribed his
own name.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S CORRESPONDENTS.</i></div>

<p>So soon as Edward’s name and address appeared
in the <i>Naturalist</i> and <i>Zoologist</i>, he was assailed by
letters from all parts of the country. English dealers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
asked him to exchange birds with them. Private
gentlemen offered exchanges of moths and butterflies.
Professors, who were making experiments on eggs,
requested contributions of eggs of all kinds. A
Naturalist in Norfolk desired to have a collection of
Sternums, or breast-bones, of birds. “I have no
doubt,” says Edward, “that many of my correspondents
thought me unceevil, but really it would have
taken a fortune in postage-stamps to have answered
their letters.”</p>

<p>But although Edward received many applications
from Naturalists in different parts of the country, he
himself applied to others to furnish names for the
specimens which he had collected. We find a letter
from Mr. Macdonald, secretary to the Elgin Museum,
referring to eighty-five Zoophytes which Edward had
sent him to be named. Edward had no other method
of obtaining the scientific names for his objects.
“The naming of them,” said Mr. Macdonald, “has
cost me some time and trouble.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some of the
Zoophytes are fine specimens; others are both fine
and rare. One or two have not as yet been met with
on our shores. They seem to be quite new.” We
also find Edward communicating with Mr. H. E.
Staunton, a well-known London Naturalist, relative
to Moths, Butterflies, Beetles, and other insects.</p>

<p>But Edward could not live on Zoophytes and
Butterflies. His increasing family demanded his attention;
and shortly after his article on “The Birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of Strathbeg” had appeared in the <i>Naturalist</i>, we find
him applying in different directions for some permanent
situation. He was willing to be a police
officer, a tidewaiter, or anything that would bring in
a proper maintenance for his family. With this
object, one of his friends at Fraserburgh made an
application to Mr. Charles W. Peach, Comptroller of
Customs at Wick. Mr. Peach was a well-known
Naturalist, and he has since become distinguished in
connection with recent discoveries in Geology. Mr.
Peach had once visited Edward, in company with Mr.
Greive, the Customs Collector at Banff. In answer
to the application made to him from Fraserburgh,
he said—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. PEACH’S LETTER.</i></div>

<p>“<i>I do</i> know our friend Mr. Edward of Banff, and
I have thought a great deal about him of late. I
have wondered how he was getting on in bread and
porridge affairs. Oh, these animal wants! How
often do they ride rough-shod over the intellectual
man, not so much on his own account, as for those
dependent on him. I have been thinking of Edward’s
excellent wife and her flock of seven girls, which I
saw when at Banff. They were all neat, and clean,
and well cared for, in a wee bit roomie—the walls
covered with cases of birds. When we called, there
was a sweet cake and a glass of wine for myself and
Mr. Greive. I was unhappy at refusing his wine—for
you know I am an out-and-out teetotaller,—but
I took his cake with thankfulness. And now, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
can I do for that good man and his wife and
family?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Mr. Peach went on to say that a great many
Glut-men were employed at Wick harbour, to patrol
the shore night and day, and prevent the landing of
brandy, tobacco, and other excisable articles; that
he could give Edward employment for a time at that
work, but that it could not be permanent. His age
was beyond that which would allow of his being
appointed a tidewaiter. Mr. Peach added—“I will
not lose sight of the appointment of subcuratorship.
This would be the very thing. If £40 or £50 a
year could be obtained, that would be glorious!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RECOURSE TO SAVINGS BANK.</i></div>

<p>These suggestions ended in disappointment.
Edward could not remove to Wick to accept a temporary
appointment; and the subcuratorship could
not be obtained. He therefore went on with his old
work—Natural History and shoemaking. But he
must have been pressed by the growing wants of his
family, as we find his collection of birds advertised
for sale at the beginning of 1855. Again he had recourse
to his Savings Bank; and again it relieved
him,—though he parted with the results of his work
during many laborious years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BIRDS OF BANFFSHIRE.</i></div>

<p>He still went on writing for the periodicals. At
the end of 1855 we find an article of his in the <i>Zoologist</i>,
entitled “Moth-hunting; or an Evening in a
Wood;” and in the following year he commenced in
the same periodical “A List of the Birds of Banffshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
accompanied with Anecdotes.” The list was
completed in eight articles, which appeared in 1856
and the two following years. Although his publications
were received with much approval, they did
not serve to increase his income, for he never received
a farthing for any of his literary contributions.</p>

<p>Before parting with Edward’s descriptions of
birds, a few extracts may be given from his articles
in the <i>Zoologist</i>. And first, about song-birds:—</p>

<p>“The Song Thrush or Mavis (<i>Turdus musicus</i>).
Who is there that has ever trod the weedy dale or
whinny brake in early spring, and, having heard the
mellow voice of this musician of the grove, was not
struck with delight, and enchanted at the peculiar
richness and softness of his tones? For my own part,
I must say that of all the birds which adorn and enliven
our woods, I love this one the most. There is
to me a sweetness in his song which few if any of the
other song-birds possess. Besides, he is one of the
first to hail with his hymn of praise the young and
opening year.</p>

<p>“Next to the Mavis the Lark or the Laverock is
the bird for me, and has been since I first learned to
love the little warblers of the woods and fields. How
oft, oh! how oft, has the lark’s dewy couch been my
bed, and its canopy, the high azure vault, been my
only covering, while overtaken by night during my
wanderings after nature; and oh! how sweet such
nights are, and how short they seem,—soothed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
I have been to repose by the evening hymn of the
lark, and aroused by their early lays at the first blink
of morn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FINCHES.</i></div>

<p>“The Goldfinch is also a good singing bird. If
any one wishes to have a cage-bird to cheer him with
its song, let him get a male hybrid between this
species and the canary, and I am sure he will not be
disappointed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Goldfinch’s nest is one of
nature’s masterpieces. What a beautiful piece of
workmanship! how exquisitely woven together! how
light, compact, soft, and warm in its internal lining!
and how complete! What hand could imitate the
woolly, feathery, mossy, cup-formed, half-ball-like
structure? How vain the attempt!</p>

<p>“The Bullfinch, though much admired as a cage-bird,
cannot be said to be much of a songster. It is
kept more for its beauty than its music, though it is
sometimes able to ‘pipe’ a very pretty tune. Now,
with respect to its food. Great numbers of bullfinches
are annually destroyed by our gardeners and nurserymen
because they are supposed to be destructive.
Now, it is a fact well known to ornithologists that,
although the sparrow, greenfinch, chaffinch, wren,
bullfinch, and other birds, do not themselves actually
live on insects, yet these form the chief food for their
young. Such being the case, what an enormous and
countless number of noxious and destructive creatures
must they destroy! But we poor short-sighted mortals
do not know this. We are all in the dark as regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the good they do us. Let them meddle with any
of our seeds or fruits, and the hue and cry is,
‘Get guns and shoot every one of them.’ I hope a
better day will soon arise for these lovely little birds,
when they will be cherished and encouraged rather
than hated and destroyed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CROWS AND CRAB-SHELLS.</i></div>

<p>The story is told of an ancient philosopher having
been killed by an eagle that dropped a tortoise upon his
head for the purpose of breaking its shell. The story
seems to be confirmed by the practice of the Carrion
and Hooded Crows, thus described by Edward:—“They
are to be found on certain parts of our coast
all the year round. Our keepers destroy them whenever
the opportunity occurs. I wonder that our
fishermen do not destroy them also, as they feed upon
a certain crustacean (<i>Carcinus mænas</i>) which is often
used for bait. One would think that the crab’s shell
would be proof against the crow; but no! He goes
aloft with the crab, and lets it fall upon a stone or a
rock chosen for the purpose. If it does not break, he
seizes it again, goes up higher, lets it fall, and repeats
his operation again and again until his object is accomplished.
When a convenient stone is once met
with, the birds resort to it for a long time. I myself
know a pretty high rock, that has been used by successive
generations of crows for about twenty years!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HERON AND THE CROWS.</i></div>

<p>“Besides being fond of crabs, these carrion crows
are fond of fish, and though they are good fishers
themselves, they seldom lose an opportunity of assailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the Heron when he has made a successful dive.
They rush at him immediately, and endeavour to
seize his food from him. Early in the summer of
1845, whilst loitering about the hills of Boyndie, I
observed a Heron flying heavily along, as if from the
sea—that rich and inexhaustible magazine of nature—and
pursued by a Carrion Crow, followed at some
distance by two Magpies. They had not proceeded
far when two Hooded Crows made their appearance
and quickly joined their black associate. The heron
had by this time got into an open space between
two woods, and it would appear that his enemies
intended to keep him there until he had satisfied their
demands. During the whole time that the affray
lasted, or nearly half an hour, they did not suffer him to
proceed above a few yards in any way, either backward
or forward, his principal movements being in
ascending or descending alternately, in order to avoid
the assaults of his pursuers. Having chosen their
battle-ground, I crept behind a whin-bush, from
whence I had an uninterrupted view of the whole
affair.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HERON ATTACKED.</i></div>

<p>“The manœuvring of the crows with the heron
was most admirable. Indeed, their whole mode of
procedure had something in it very remarkable. So
well did each seem to understand his position, that
the one never interfered with the other’s point of
attack. One, rising higher than the heron, descended
upon him like a dart, aiming the blow in general at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
his head; another at the same time pecked at him
sideways and from before; whilst the third assailed
him from beneath and behind. The third crow,
which pecked at him from behind, seized hold of the
heron’s feet, which being extended at full length
backwards, formed a very tempting and prominent
object for the crow to fix on. This movement had
the effect, each time, of turning the heron over, which
was the signal for a general outburst of exultation
among the three black rogues, manifested by their
louder cawings and whimsical gesticulations,—no
doubt laughing (if crows can laugh) at seeing their
opponent turning topsy-turvy in the air, which, from
his unwieldy proportions, was rather a comical sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HERON ROBBED.</i></div>

<p>“During one of his sommersaults, the heron disgorged
something, but, unfortunately for him, it was
not observed by any of the crows. When it fell
to the ground, the magpies, which were still chattering
about, fell upon it and devoured it. Finding no
relief from what he had dropped, and being still hard
pressed, he again disgorged what appeared to be a
small fish. This was noticed by one of the hooded
crows, who speedily descended, picked it up, and
made off with it, leaving his two companions to fight
the battle out. The heron, having now got rid of one
of his pursuers, determined to fly away in spite of all
opposition. But his remaining assailants, either disappointed
at the retreat of their comrade, or irritated
at the length of the struggle, recommenced their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
attack with renewed vigour. So artfully did they
manage, that they kept the heron completely at bay,
and baffled all his endeavours to get away. Wearied
at last of the contest, he once more dropped something,
which, from its length, seemed to be an eel. On
its being observed by his opponents, they quickly
followed it. In their descent, they fell a fighting
with each other. The consequence was that the eel,
falling to the ground, was set upon by the magpies.
The crows gave up fighting, descended to the ground,
and assailed the magpies. The latter were soon repulsed.
Then the crows seized hold of the eel with
their bills, and kept pulling at it until eventually
it broke in two. Each kept hold of its portion, when
they shortly rose up and flew away amongst the trees.
In the meantime, the heron was observed winging his
way in the distance; sick at heart, because he had
been plundered by thieves, and robbed of the food
which he had intended for his family.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CROWS, HARES, AND RABBITS.</i></div>

<p>The Carrion and Hooded Crows also attack hares
and rabbits. “Whilst walking one morning along
the Deveron with a friend, our attention was attracted
by what seemed to us to be the faint cries of a child
in distress. On looking in the direction from which
the sounds proceeded, we beheld two crows pursuing
and tormenting a hare, by every now and then pouncing
down upon it. Each blow seemed to be aimed
at the head; and each time that one was given
the hare screamed piteously. The blows soon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the effect of stupifying the creature. Sometimes
they felled it to the ground. We eventually
lost sight of the crows, but doubtless they would at
last kill and devour the hare. I remember, while
out on the hills at Boyndie, witnessing another
though a less daring attack. Concealed amongst some
trees and bushes, waiting for a Cuckoo which I expected
to pass, I observed a half-grown rabbit emerge
from some whins, and begin to frolic about close by.
Presently down pops a Hoodie, and approaches the
rabbit, whisking, prancing, and jumping. He seemed
to be most friendly, courteous, and humoursome to
the little rabbit. All of a sudden, however, as if he
meant to finish the joke with a ride, he mounts the
back of the rabbit. Up springs the latter, and away
he runs. But short was his race. A few sturdy blows
about the head, from the bill of the crow, laid him
dead in a few seconds.”</p>

<p>By the year 1858 Edward had accumulated
another splendid collection. It was his third, and probably
his best. The preserved birds were in splendid
order. Most of them were in their natural condition—flying,
or fluttering, pecking or feeding,—with their
nests, their eggs, and sometimes their young. He had
also a large collection of insects—including many
rare beetles,—together with numerous Fishes, Crustaceans,
Zoophytes, Molluscs, Fossils, and Plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLD AND WHISKY.</i></div>

<p>Although Edward still continued his midnight explorations,
he felt that he must soon give them up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Lying out at night cannot be long endured in this
country. It is not the cold, so much as the damp,
that rheumatises the muscles and chills the bones.
When going out at night, Edward was often advised
to take whisky with him. He was told that if he
would drink it when he got wet or cold, it would refresh
and sustain him, and otherwise do him a great
deal of good. Those who knew of his night-wanderings,
wondered how he could ever have endured the night air
and been kept alive without the liberal use of whisky.
But Edward always refused. He never took a drop
of whisky with him,—indeed, he never drank it
either at home or abroad. “I believe,” he says,
“that if I had indulged in drink, or even had I used
it at all on these occasions, I could never have
stood the cold, the wet, and the other privations to
which I was exposed. As for my food, it mainly consisted
of good oatmeal cakes. It tasted very sweet,
and was washed down with water from the nearest
spring. Sometimes, when I could afford it, my wife
boiled an egg or two, and these were my only luxuries.
But, as I have already said, water was my only drink.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S HEALTH FAILS.</i></div>

<p>In 1858, Edward had reached his forty-fourth year.
At this age, men who have been kindly reared and
fairly fed, are usually in their prime, both of mind
and body. But Edward had used himself very hardly;
he had spent so many of his nights out of doors,
in the cold and the wet; he had been so tumbled
about amongst the rocks; he had so often, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
all his labours, to endure privation, even to the
extent of want of oatmeal,—that it is scarcely to be
wondered at if, at that time, his constitution should
have begun to show marks of decay. He had been
frequently laid up by colds and rheumatism. Yet,
when able to go out again, he usually returned to his
old courses.</p>

<p>At last his health gave way altogether. He was
compelled to indulge in the luxury of a doctor. The
doctor was called in, and found Edward in a rheumatic
fever, with an ulcerated sore throat. There he
lay, poor man, his mind wandering about his birds.
He lay for a month. He got over his fever, but he
recovered his health slowly. The doctor had a
serious talk with him. Edward was warned against
returning to his old habits. He was told that although
his constitution had originally been sound and
healthy, it had, by constant exertion and exposure to
cold and wet, become impaired to a much greater
degree than had at first been supposed. Edward was
also distinctly informed that if he did not at once
desist from his nightly wanderings, his life would not
be worth a farthing. Here, it appeared, was to be
the end of his labours in Natural History.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SELLS HIS COLLECTION.</i></div>

<p>Next came the question of family expenditure and
doctor’s bills. Edward had been ill for a month,
and the debts incurred during that time must necessarily
be paid. There was his only Savings Bank—his
collection of birds—to meet the difficulty. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was forced to draw upon it again. Accordingly, part
of it was sold. Upwards of forty cases of birds
went, together with three hundred specimens of
mosses and marine plants, with other objects not
contained in cases. When these were sold, Edward
lost all hopes of ever being able again to replenish
his shattered collection.</p>

<p>Although Edward’s strength had for the most part
been exhausted, his perseverance was not. We shall
next find him resorting to another branch of Natural
History, in which he gathered his most distinguished
laurels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small><i>BY THE SEA-SHORE.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> had for some time been extending his investigations
to the tenants of the deep. His wanderings
had for the most part been along-shore in search of
sea-birds. But, as early as 1856, we find him corresponding
with Mr. Macdonald of Elgin as to Zoophytes,
with Mr. Blackwood of Aberdeen as to Algæ,
and with Mr. C. Spence Bate of Plymouth as to Crustacea.
Now that he had to abandon his night wanderings,
and to give up his gun, he resolved to
devote himself more particularly to the Natural
History of the sea-shore.</p>

<p>Here was a great field open for him. The
Moray Firth had never been properly searched for
marine productions. It was full of fish, and also of
the various marine objects that fish feed upon.</p>

<p>When Professor Macgillivray called upon Edward
at Banff, he expressed his surprise at the meagreness
of the list of Crustacea and Testacea found along the
Moray coast. In fact, the catalogue of Fishes (excepting
herring, cod, haddock, and the other edible
fishes) was almost barren. There was no want of
marine objects; the principal want was, in careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
observers. To this extensive field of observation,
Edward now proposed to devote his special attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S SEA-TRAPS.</i></div>

<p>He had considerable difficulty to encounter in proceeding
with this branch of scientific work. He had
no dredge of any sort. He had no boat, nor could he
obtain the loan of one. How then did he proceed?
He gathered together all the old pots, pans, pails,
and kettles, which he could procure in his neighbourhood.
He filled these with straw, grass, bits
of old clothes, or bits of blankets. A coat and
trousers cut down were found very useful. These were
Edward’s sea-traps. Having put a heavyish stone at
the bottom of the trap to weigh it down, and attached
a rope to the upper part, he lowered his traps into
the deeper rock-pools along the coast. Some of them
he threw into the sea from the point of a rock, attaching
the rope to a stone, or to some strong Algæ.</p>

<p>When the traps were drawn up, Edward obtained
from them small fishes, crustaceans, molluscs (with
or without shells), starfish, worms, and the smaller
kinds of sea-mice. He took them to a shallow pool,
and shook out the contents; and when he had picked
out what he thought might be useful, he packed the
traps again, and set them in their old places. He
usually visited his sea-traps once a month; but in
winter he visited them less frequently, as he rarely
took anything at that time of the year.</p>

<p>Edward visited the rocky shore for many miles east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and west of Banff. He turned over the loose stones,
turned up the Algæ, peeped in beneath the corners
and shelves of the projecting rocks. He went to the
pools, and often had the pleasure of seeing the inhabitants
working in their native element. If he observed
something that he wanted, he would make a
dive at it, though the water might get up to his head
and shoulders. Sometimes he fell in bodily; but that
did not matter much if he secured his object.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAPTURES A RARE FISH.</i></div>

<p>Here is the manner in which he once caught Bloch’s
Gurnard (<i>Trigla Blochii</i>). Edward observed one of
them swimming in a rock pool. It had by some means
or other come pretty close inshore during high water,
and had got entangled amongst the rocks, so that it had
been unable to make its way out again with the receding
tide. The pool, though not deep, was pretty large,
so that it gave Edward a great deal of trouble and
occupied a considerable time to capture the fish. “If
it had not,” says he, “been a rarity, I should most certainly
have given in and acknowledged myself beaten
long before my object was accomplished; for between
water and perspiration I was in a pitiable plight before
I gained the victory. As it was, however, I was
well repaid in the end, besides the fun; that is, if
there is any other person than myself so foolish as to
call splashing up to the shoulders and eyes amongst
brine, seaweed, and slippery rocks, ‘fun.’ Although
the fish is not large, mine is a splendidly-marked specimen.
In the water, and whilst shooting across and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
athwart the pool, its bright colours had a most beautiful
appearance. The spot on the first dorsal is rather
of a dark-purplish colour than black, and very conspicuous
when the animal is swimming. I am not
aware of this species ever before having been detected
on this part of the coast.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INCOMING WAVE.</i></div>

<p>Knowing from observation that many marine
objects are cast on shore at the rising of each tide,
especially when the weather is stormy, Edward walked
along the margin of the incoming wave, ready to pick
up anything that might be driven ashore. Sometimes
he would observe some object in the water—a fish or
a shrimp of some unusual kind—which he desired to
capture. He followed it into the sea with a piece of
gauze tied on a small hoop; and fished for it until he
had caught it. He discovered many new objects in
this way.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible what may be got along the
sea-margin, by carefully searching the incoming wave.
This, however, required unwearied assiduity. Edward
discovered many of his rarest insects amongst those
driven ashore by the wind. It was thus that he
obtained most of his rare Crustaceans. He himself
had no doubt, that, had his health been prolonged, he
would have discovered many more.</p>

<p>Besides these methods for collecting marine objects,
he found that tangle roots were a special hiding-place
for many species that were beyond the power of
the dredge, and that never entered the traps set by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
him along shore. They were not, however, beyond
the power of the elements. But for the tempest, that
tears them from the rocks, and dashes them on shore,
such objects would never have been found. Whenever
a storm occurred in the Moray Firth, Edward
immediately went out, collected the tangle which had
been driven in, cut off as many roots as he could carry
with him, and carefully examined them at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FISHES THE BEST DREDGERS.</i></div>

<p>He was also greatly helped by the fishes themselves,
as well as by the fishermen. It is true that
he had no dredge and no boat. But big fish were
themselves the best of all dredgers. They fed far
out at sea, at a depth where the dredge could scarcely
reach. The fishermen caught them, and brought them
into port, full of what they had swallowed. Edward
therefore endeavoured to obtain the contents of their
stomachs. For this purpose he sent some of his
daughters to the neighbouring fishing villages. They
went to Macduff and Whitehills twice a week, and
to the Banff fishermen daily. The object of their
visits was, to search the fishermen’s lines, to bring
away the sea-weed and all the stuff that was attached
to them, and to secure as many of the fish stomachs
as they could find. One of his daughters was sent to
Gardenstown, where she lived with a friend. From
thence, she sent home her collection of fish stomachs
twice a week by the carrier. All this rubbish (as
most people called it) was carefully examined by
Edward. From these searchings he obtained most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of his rarest crustaceans. “It is quite wonderful,” he
says, “what is to be got in this way. Indeed, no one
would believe it who has not made the experiment.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COD’S BILL OF FARE.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CODS AND HADDOCKS.</i></div>

<p>Take, for instance, the Cod’s bill of fare. “It is
to the stomach of this species,” says Edward, “that
I am most indebted for many of the rarest of the
testaceous and crustaceous specimens that I possess.
I will only mention what I have myself seen: crabs
and lobsters of almost every description (except <i>Homarus
vulgaris</i>, which I have never yet found), from
the prickly Stone Crab (<i>Lithodes maia</i>) up to the
hard Parten (<i>Cancer pagurus</i>), and the larger the
better. Shells of every sort, particularly <i>Fusus antiquus</i>
and <i>Buccinium Undatum</i>; no matter whether
inhabited by their original possessor, or by a hermit
in the form of a Pagurus,—it is no obstacle to the
voracious Cod. Shrimps, fish-lice, sea-mice (<i>Aphrodita
aculeata</i>), sea-urchins, with now and then a starfish;
‘Dead Men’s Paps,’ as they are called here
(<i>Alcyonium</i>), and Actinias—no matter what they may
be attached to, whether a shell or a stone,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> provided
these are not themselves fixtures,—all are gulped by
this most unceremonious fish. The eggs, capsules, or
purses of the Dog-fish (<i>Scyllium</i>) and the Skate, with
the roe and the ova of other species, particularly when
deposited on seaweed; the Algæ and the Zoophytes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
also walk down the Cod’s gullet, so that nothing may
be lost. As for the <i>Holothuridæ</i> or Sea-cucumbers,
few if any of them escape. Now and then fragments
of the Medusæ are swallowed; feathers, with the
remains of sea-fowl; and, on one occasion, the skeleton
of a <i>partridge</i>, with the wings, feet, legs, and head
adhering. Pieces of pewter and of cloth occasionally;
and once a cluster of beech-nuts, with part of a
domestic fowl. As for fish!—why, the fish does not
swim that the Cod, when hungry, will not attack, and, if
successful, swallow. In short, nothing seems to come
amiss. But this outline of the Cod’s bill of fare does
not include all that the animal preys upon and
devours. It is enough, however, to show its epicurean
propensities. The Cod is extensively fished
for along this part of the coast, and may be termed
<i>the poor man’s salmon</i>. Great numbers are salted and
dried, and in that state are sent to the southern markets.
The Haddock, like the Cod, is extensively
taken, and largely cured and forwarded south. Like
the Cod, the stomach of this species is also a rich
mine for the Naturalist, as the reader may already have
anticipated from the foregoing list.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>APPEAL TO THE FISHERMEN.</i></div>

<p>In order to obtain all these products of the sea,
Edward went round among the fishermen from Crovie
to Portsoy, and pressed them to help him in his
researches. He told them that many an object of
great interest to Naturalists was daily thrown away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Though it might be of no use to them, it might prove
of great use to science. “Oh!” said the fishermen,
“we canna tell what the fellow wants: we get so
muckle trash upon our lines. Are we to keep it all?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Edward, “keep it all. Lay it carefully
aside, and I or my daughters will call for it.”
A few of the fishermen did what Edward told them
to do; but the others “couldna be fashed.”</p>

<p>Edward published his advice to the fishermen in
the <i>Banffshire Journal</i>. “How little trouble,” he
said, “would it be for any fisherman who might find
a rare fish, crab, shell, or zoophyte, or such like object
attached to his lines, to get it examined and named,
so that its occurrence might be recorded. This could
be done, and then he could, if so minded, dispose of
it to the best advantage. Or what great ‘fash’ could
it be for them to keep the cleanings of their lines for
a like scientific purpose?</p>

<p>“It is quite astonishing what amazing numbers of
minute creatures are at times to be found amongst
the refuse of only one boat’s lines. No one would
believe it, except those who are in the habit of carefully
examining such things. The ocean is, as it
were, one vast and boundless expanse of life, and the
inhabitants thereof about as numberless as the sands
by the sea-shore. I have myself, and that too under
the most disadvantageous circumstances, picked off
from a dead valve of <i>Cyprina Islandica</i> nine distinct
species of shells, three different kinds of starfish, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
five separate sorts of zoophytes, besides worms and a
number of other parasitical animals. Yet this is
nothing to what is at times to be met with; and yet
such things are, I may say, all but universally thrown
away for no other or better purpose than that of being
trod upon and destroyed. I will now, in order to
show the truthfulness of my statement, enumerate a
few of the objects which have thus been cast aside by
those who had brought them on shore, but which were
again picked up by my <i>gleaners</i>, and thereby redeemed,
as it were, for a time from destruction, by being deposited
in my collection:—<i>Anomia patelliformis</i>, <i>Circe
minuta</i>, <i>Venus casina</i>, <i>Venus fasciata</i>, <i>Tellina proxima</i>,
<i>Tellina crassa</i>, <i>Mangelia linearis</i>, <i>Pentunculus glycimeris</i>,
<i>Psammobia tellinella</i>, <i>Astarte compressa</i>, <i>Corbula
nucleus</i>, <i>Emarginula reticulata</i>, <i>Thracia villiosulca</i>,
<i>Chiton lævis</i>, etc. etc.</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t say that these are all new species,
but I say that they are amongst the rarest of our
shells. The two first named are, if I mistake not,
new, not only to us, but new to this northern part
of the island. In works on Conchology, no mention
is made of either having been previously found on the
shores of the Moray Firth, although they are not unfrequent
on other parts of the British coast.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FISHERMEN HELP HIM.</i></div>

<p>The fishermen of Macduff helped him greatly.
Amongst the rare fishes caught by them were the
Sandsucker (<i>Platessa limandoides</i>); the Small Spotted
Dog-fish (<i>Scyllium canicula</i>); the Blue-striped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Wrasse (<i>Labrus variegatus</i>), a very rare fish; a specimen
of the Cuttle-fish (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>), the length
of which was four feet, with a splendid Gladius of
above fifteen inches long. In enumerating these fishes
brought to him by the fishermen of Macduff, Edward
asked, “What are our own Banff fishermen and those
of Whitehills about, that they never bring in any
rare objects of this sort? Do they never get anything
attached to their lines worthy of notice—worthy of a
place in a Naturalist’s cabinet, or in a corner of the
Museum? Why won’t they help us? Just because
of their want of Will. They, like many more, go
about in what might be termed a state of daylight somnambulism;
that is, with eyes and ears both open,
and yet they neither see nor hear of any of these
things.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WELCOME STRANGER.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SAURY PIKE.</i></div>

<p>Edward’s appeal was at length responded to. The
fishermen began to collect things for him, and they
allowed his girls to strip their nets of “the rubbish”
they contained. One evening some unknown fisherman
sent him a present of a Saury Pike (<i>Scomberesox
saurius</i>). Edward’s family were surprised at hearing
some person, very heavily shod, ascending the stairs.
One said it was a horse and cart; another said it was
the Rooshians. The door was suddenly opened and
flung bang against the wall, when in rushed—neither
the horse and cart nor the Rooshians,—but a little
urchin, out of breath, with his mouth wide open. There
he stood, staring bewildered round the room; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
with a fish of a silvery hue dangling from his hand.
After he had regained his breath he roared out, “Is
Tam in?” “No.” “’Cause I ha’e a beast till him.”
“Fa gi’ed ye’t?” “A man.” “Fatna man?”
“Dinna ken!” “Fat like was he?” “Canna tell.”
“Fat had he on?” “Dinna mind; only that he had
a coat ower his airm.” “Fat said he t’ye when he
gi’ed ye the beast?” “Oh, he bade me take it till Tam
Edward, and get a penny for’t till mysel.”</p>

<p>The fish was accepted, the penny was given, and
the boy tramped downstairs again. On returning
home, Edward found a splendid specimen of the above
rare fish. The next number of the <i>Journal</i> acknowledged
receipt of the fish. In the article describing
it, Edward said—“By whom the fish was sent, or
where it was found (though doubtless in the neighbourhood,
from its freshness), remains as yet a mystery.
However, thanks to ‘the man with the coat ower his
airm’ in the meantime, and to many others whose
kindness and attention, though their gifts are not particularised
here, are nevertheless duly appreciated:
Likewise, and in an especial manner, thanks to the
fishermen generally of the district, particularly to our
own and those of Whitehills, not only for their now
unremitting attention in securing whatever they deem
worthy of notice themselves; but also, and above all,
for their very valuable assistance given, and their
warm-hearted kindness shown to my young folks
when they go a-gleaning amongst them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S GIRLS HELP HIM.</i></div>

<p>Indeed, Edward’s young folks were of great help
to him at this time. Several of his eldest girls went
about from place to place in search of rare fish, and
they were sometimes very successful. For instance,
one of them, whilst living with Mr. Gordon at Gardenstown,
went on a zoologising excursion towards
the village of Crovie. As the two were rounding the
Snook, they observed a small fish being washed ashore.
Mr. Gordon kicked it with his foot, thinking it was
of no use, and remarking that it was a young sea-cat.
“Na,” said Maggie, “it’s nae sea-cat; it’s ower thin
for that. I dinna ken fat it is, but I’ll take it and
send it hame to my father, for he bade me never to
miss naething o’ this kine.” So the fish was sent
home, and it proved to be a very fine specimen of
Yarrell’s Blenny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EQUOREAL NEEDLE-FISH.</i></div>

<p>On another occasion she sent home a specimen of
the Black Goby or Rock-fish (<i>Gobius niger</i>), which had
been taken from the stomach of a friendly cod. This
was the first fish of the kind found in the Moray Firth;
and of the six species of Gobies found along the coasts
of Great Britain, it is the one most seldom met with.
Maggie also made a good “find” at Fraserburgh, while
on a zoological tour with her father. She was rummaging
about amongst the sands, near Broadsea, accompanied
by some of her acquaintances, when she
observed something sticking up out of the sand. At
first she thought it was a piece of tangle. She was
about to leave it, when, prompted by curiosity, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
gave it a pull, when, lo and behold! instead of a seaweed,
she brought out a long spindle-like fish. She
at once took it to her father, who found it to be a
splendid specimen of the Equoreal Needle-fish (<i>Syngnathus
æquoreus</i>), a fish that had never before been
found in the Moray Firth.</p>

<div class="caption">BROADSEA, NEAR FRASERBURGH.</div>
</div>

<p>A thought may here strike the reader. How was it
that Edward knew that there were six Gobies found
along the coasts of Great Britain? How did he know
that the Equoreal Needle-fish had never been found in
the Moray Firth before? And, last of all, How was it
that he knew the scientific names of the Fishes, the
Zoophytes, and the Crustacea, which he collected?
The names were, for the most part, Latin. Yet he
had never learnt Latin. He must then have learnt
them from books. No! He had no books. He often
ardently desired books; but he was too poor to buy
them. His earnings were scarcely sufficient to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
him to feed and clothe his children. Under such
circumstances a man cannot buy books. Sometimes
his children fared very badly, especially when he was
laid up by illness. At such times they had almost
to starve.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S INFORMANTS.</i></div>

<p>How was it then that, under these difficult circumstances,
and amidst his almost constant poverty,
Edward was enabled to carry on the study of science
without the aid of books? He did so by the help of
correspondents at a distance. When he collected a
batch of objects, he sent them off by post to Naturalists
in different parts of the country, for the purpose of
obtaining from them the proper names. They referred
to their scientific works, and furnished him with the
necessary information.</p>

<p>Edward sent his specimens of Crustacea to Mr.
Spence Bate, of Plymouth, Devonshire; his fishes to
Mr. Couch, of Polperro, Cornwall; and many other
objects to correspondents in Norwich, York, Newcastle,
Birmingham, and London. The Rev. George
Gordon, of the manse of Birnie, Elginshire, was one
of his first correspondents respecting the Crustacea.
Mr. Spence Bate was then engaged (in conjunction
with Professor Westwood) in writing the <i>History of
the British Sessile-eyed Crustacea</i>. Mr. Gordon first
forwarded to him some of Edward’s specimens, and
Edward afterwards corresponded directly with Mr.
Bate. Thus he obtained his scientific knowledge,
not from the books in his own neighbourhood, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
from the books of gentlemen sometimes living at the
opposite ends of the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOW TO HELP HIM.</i></div>

<p>There was, indeed, some talk of supplying Edward
with books, to enable him to pursue his scientific
researches. At a public dinner in Banff, the principal
speaker, after paying a high compliment to
Edward for his wonderful perseverance, and his
devotion to Natural Science, proceeded to describe
the great influence which books exercised in developing
the powers of the human mind. After informing
his audience that they did not know the
value of the man they had got amongst them, he
said, “Assist and encourage him by all the means
in your power, but”—here he paused, and all eyes
were turned upon him;—“but,” he continued, “give
him no money—(loud cheers). I know him, as you
all do, to be no drunkard, no idler, but a sober hard-working
man. But still, I again say, give him no
money. Give him Books; provide him with the
means of reading, and he is just the man to make
money for himself.” The auditors thought that they
had done sufficient justice to Edward by cheering the
proposal of the orator; but it was words—mere
words; for Edward neither got a book, nor even
the leaf of a book, from any of his local admirers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S ENTHUSIASM.</i></div>

<p>How different from this cold counsel, was the
enthusiasm of Edward when speaking of his favourite
science. In an article which appeared in the <i>Naturalist</i>
on the Rayed Echinodermata of Banffshire, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
regretting the small amount of observation and research
which had been made along the shores of the
Moray Firth, he said, “It is a great pity that the
Moray Firth was never dredged by naturalists, as I
am led to believe it never was, on a scale worthy of
its waters. If such were done, and done as it should
be, I am quite sure, from what I know, that many a
valuable rarity, and, I have no doubt, many new
species, would be procured, and better got than those
already known. If I were but possessed of half the
means that some are, it should not long be so. Wind
and weather permitting, I should have it dredged
from the one end to the other, over and over again.
Alas! that Nature, that fair and comely damsel, whom
I supremely admire and love so well, should have
called me into existence at the very moment when
<i>Want</i> and <i>Starvation</i> stood hand in hand, ready to
stamp the unconscious heir of immortality with their
accursed brands. Money, it is said, is the root of all
evil; but tell me, ye who know, what the want of
it is!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS LOST LETTERS.</i></div>

<p>We have already said that Edward, because of his
want of books on Natural History, obtained the principal
knowledge of the objects which he discovered
from gentlemen at a distance. But even this was not
accomplished without difficulty. It was not always
a pleasant task, and sometimes it was rather expensive,—expensive
at least for a poor man. He occasionally
encountered disagreeable rebuffs. Some complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
that they could not read his writing, and that
what he said was unintelligible. Another hindrance
was, that when he sent a number of new specimens
to Naturalists at a distance, they were often kept, and
thanks only were returned. But he was scarcely in
a position to resent this conduct. At last he sent
none but those of which he had duplicates, preferring
to keep them without a name rather than run the
risk of losing them altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. NEWMAN OF ‘THE ZOOLOGIST’.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Edward Newman of London, editor of the
<i>Zoologist</i>, was one of those who helped Edward with
books. He also named many of Edward’s Beetles
and other Insects, which were sent to him for identification.
The correspondence<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> between them originated
in Edward’s articles on the Birds of Banffshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
which began to appear in the <i>Zoologist</i> in August
1856. Mr. Newman sent Edward several books on
Natural History, together with his own <i>List of British
Birds</i>. In February 1858 we find Mr. Newman sending
Edward a copy of the <i>Insect Hunters</i>, his most
successful book. Mr. Newman said to Edward,
“I think it really wonderful that you should have
acquired the great knowledge you have obtained
under the circumstances in which you have been
placed.” Mr. Newman asked for some information
about fishes, which Edward promised to supply.
The result was, that many new fishes were found in
the Moray Firth, simply from Edward’s determination
to search, collect, and preserve them.</p>

<p>Edward had also much correspondence with Mr.
Alexander G. More, with respect to the distribution
of birds in Great Britain during the nesting season.
Edward was appointed the observer for Banffshire and
the northern part of Aberdeen. He communicated a
great deal of information about Birds and Bird-nesting,
which was afterwards published in the periodical
called <i>The Ibis</i>.</p>

<p>But his most important communications were with
Mr. Couch as to Fishes; and with Mr. Spence Bate,
and the Rev. A. Merle Norman, as to Crustacea;
which will form the subjects of the following chapters.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small><i>DISCOVERIES AMONG THE CRUSTACEA.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will find this chapter, as well as the next,
rather uninteresting. But it is necessary that the
chapters should be written, in order to show the contributions
which Edward made to the scientific discoveries
of his day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR. BATE.</i></div>

<p>Mr. C. Spence Bate of Plymouth, the well-known
zoologist, entered into correspondence with Edward
in 1856, while the latter was engaged in collecting
marine objects along the sea-coast of Banff. It
appears that Mr. Bate had sent to Edward some
publications on Natural History, and that Edward
requested Mr. Bate to name the various Crustaceans
which he sent him. To this Mr. Bate willingly
assented, and a correspondence began between them,
which continued for many years. Most of the letters
have been lost, and those which have been preserved
“in the box in the lumber garret” are not of very
great interest.</p>

<p>Edward seems to have been particularly busy between
the years 1861 and 1865. Multitudes of
bottles were sent, during that interval, from Banff to
Plymouth. The bottles were often smashed in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
through the post. Sometimes there was only a mass
of debris to examine. In one batch there was a
new species of Leucothoe; in another, part of an
Eusirus—“the <i>first</i> British specimen.”</p>

<p>In one of his letters, Mr. Bate says: “There are two
minute specimens of a prawn which I do not recognise.
They are too much damaged for examination;
but if you can find any perfect ones like these, I should
like you to send them to me. I will send you shortly
a paper that I have recently published in the <i>Annals
of Natural History</i> on the “Nest-Building Crustacea.”
If you know or meet with any anecdotes relative to
these animals, I should be glad if you would communicate
them to me, as I am endeavouring to collect
all of that kind that I can. I assure you that your
letters are always welcome, and much valued.”</p>

<p>In the midst of Edward’s explorations, he discovered
a new Isopod, which he forwarded to Mr.
Bate. It was specifically named, in honour of the
discoverer, <i>Praniza Edwardii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> On subsequent examination,
and after comparing it with the Anceus,
Messrs. Bate and Westwood changed the name into
<i>Anceus Edwardii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ANCEUS.</i></div>

<p>The Anceus is only about a sixth of an inch in
length. But, in Natural History, size goes for nothing.
The minutest animal is equal to the largest, in point
of value and interest. The Anceus creeps on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
bottom of the sea; but it swims with great rapidity,—propelling
itself forward by the quick motions of a
series of ciliated fins placed beneath the tail. The
Anceus, in its young state, is parasitical, and is
furnished with a sharp process at the apex of the
anterior lip, to form a strong lanceolate organ, with
which the animal cuts its way through the skin of the
fish on which it preys. It was at first thought that
<i>Praniza Edwardii</i> was a female, and that the male
had not yet been discovered. On seeing this stated
in the number of the <i>Sessile-eyed Crustacea</i> in which
the Praniza was noticed, Edward wrote the following
letter to Mr. Spence Bate:—</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/image265.jpg" width="332" height="290" alt="bug and larvae" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Praniza Edwardii.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larva.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRANIZA EDWARDII.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Sir—Some considerable time ago I sent you
amongst other things, what I believed to be two distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
species of Anceus,—the one being considerably smaller than
the other. Of the lesser, there were several specimens; but
of the larger, only two. The answer which you gave me was,
that they were <i>Anceus maxillaris</i>. At this I was somewhat
disappointed. I admit that the larger were of that species,
but not the smaller. And since I received your last number,
which treats on this subject, I am now more than ever convinced
that they are distinct. I consider the smaller specimen
to be the male of the <i>Praniza Edwardii</i>. I may be
wrong, but that is my conviction. I need not, of course, attempt
to point out the distinctions to you; but perhaps you
will allow me to state a few words on the subject, and what
makes me think that he is the male of <i>Praniza Edwardii</i>.</p>

<p>“In the first place, I would say that this little fellow is
decidedly a deep-sea species,—that is, so far as my experience
goes. I have never found him but on the old shells
and stones brought up by the fishermen’s lines. There he
seems to prowl about seeking what he may devour,—prying
into every crevice and corner in search of food, and also into
the tenantless worm-cases with which these old shells and
stones are generally encrusted. Now these are exactly the
habitats and manners of the <i>Praniza Edwardii</i> when adult.
Where I find the one, I am almost sure to find the other.
I have found them together, and taken them out of the same
worm-tube. But though this does not amount to an entire
proof, still it helps to strengthen my conjecture that they are
male and female.</p>

<p>“In the second place, besides the striking disparity in
size, the mandibles in this species appear to me to differ considerably
from the same organs in the <i>Anceus maxillaris</i>.
Here I have never seen them to overlap each other as they
do in the one just named. And, having frequently kept
them alive, I have seen their mandibles open and shut times
without number; and, so far as I could make out, they never
crossed each other in the least. Indeed, I do not think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
could have done so, from their construction. They seem to
me, when they do shut, to go together in the fashion of a
rat-trap when closed. And besides several other distinctions
which I have been able to discern, there are two or three small
bunches of stiff hairs or spines projecting from the front of the
head which I do not see in <i>Anceus maxillaris</i> and the others
which you describe. I would also point out that there is a
most remarkable similarity in the tail or hind-part of this
species and the same portion of the <i>Praniza Edwardii</i>.”</p></div>

<p>In support of his views, Edward forwarded some
further specimens of the supposed male to Mr. Bate,
for his inspection. We have not been able to find
Mr. Bate’s answer. It has doubtless been lost, like
many of the missing letters. But we gather from a
future letter of Edward, that Mr. Bate considered
the specimens to be <i>Anceus rapax</i>. “Never having
seen a description or plate of that species,” said
Edward, “I can say nothing as to that matter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But, call him what you like, I am more than ever
persuaded that he is the tight little husband of
<i>Praniza Edwardii</i>; and, as such, I now intend to
place them together, and to name them accordingly.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CRUSTACEA.</i></div>

<p>Many of the Crustacea which Edward collected,
did not belong to the Sessile-eyed order, which
Mr. Bate was studying and classifying. These Crustaceans
he sent to other observers. For instance, when
Mr. Bate was about to set out for Paris to examine
Milne-Edward’s typical Crustacea, he received from
Edward a letter containing some Entomostraca which
had been collected from the stomach of a mackerel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
“I do not,” replied Mr. Bate, “study the Entomostraceous
Crustacea myself; so I gave some of those you
sent me to Mr. Lubbock, and some to Dr. Baird of the
British Museum, from both of whom I hope you will
hear.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHORT SUN FISH PARASITES.</i></div>

<p>In a future letter, Edward sent Mr. Bate some
worm-like parasites found on a Short Sun Fish taken
near Banff. “The genus,” said Edward, “is very
little known in this country. It has hitherto been
found only on the Flying Fish. It seems, however, to
frequent the Sun Fish. This was not previously known.
When once these creatures take a firm hold, it is impossible
to shake them off or get rid of them,—they
sink so deep into the animal’s body. There are from
two to three longish barbs which protrude from the
neck, close to the head, and which appear to serve
exactly the same purpose as the barb does on the
hook. One which I cut out—and no easy matter it
was—had its head sunk at least an inch and a half
into the fatty ridge of the fish. In the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> of July 10th, 1858, there is an illustration
given of a Flying Fish with a parasite attached
to its back, and having a lot of barnacles adhering to
it. The fish here figured is said to have leapt from the
sea into the mizen chains of the East Indiaman
<i>Monarch</i>, whilst on her homeward voyage from Calcutta.
The parasite in that case was quite different
from the one I obtained from the Sun Fish. It was
there called <i>Pennella Blanvillii</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MICROSCOPE.</i></div>

<p>In one of his communications, Edward sent Mr.
Bate some parasites which he had taken from the
gills of a Crab. Many of the Crustaceans found by
him were so minute that they could scarcely be
examined in detail with the naked eye. Mr. Bate
accordingly, with great kindness, made Edward a present
of a microscope to enable him to carry on his
minute investigations. “It is,” said Mr. Bate, in his
letter announcing the departure of the parcel, “what
we call a simple microscope, and I think you will find
it adapted for examining things out of or in doors.
It is made portable, and can be used upon the rocks
as well as in a parlour. It is similar to one which I
use myself for everything, excepting when I examine
into structural anatomy. I was not able,” added Mr.
Bate, “to have it prepaid farther than Bristol; so I
beg to enclose a few stamps, which I hope will cover
it for the remainder of the way.”</p>

<p>Edward at first found a difficulty in managing the
microscope, on which Mr. Bate sent him a long letter
illustrated by diagrams, informing him how he was
to use it. “I am sure,” he said, “you are too sharp
a fellow not to understand it thoroughly after these
few hints have been given you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will also send
you a pocket lens, which you will find very useful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You will find it convenient during this cold
weather (24th November) to bring home anything,
and then look at it at your leisure, rather than study
it upon the sea-shore.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A POSSIBLE SUB-CURATORSHIP.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Bate must have been a thoroughly kind and
good-hearted man. He may possibly have heard
something of the circumstances of Edward, and he
was now on the look-out for some higher vocation for
the Naturalist than that of “ladies’ shoemaker.” The
Rev. George Gordon, also a zoologist, who was in
constant communication with Mr. Bate, may have
probably informed him of Edward’s ambition, which
was, to be appointed curator or sub-curator of some
important museum. Hence Mr. Bate’s letter to
Edward. After informing him that Mr. Lubbock
would shortly ask him to make a collection of Crustacea,
and advising him to send certain fishes in
proof spirit to the British Museum, he proceeded,—</p>

<p>“I have one thing more to say; but I write in
ignorance of your circumstances, and therefore, if I
tread upon a <i>corn</i>, pray forgive me. I have been
asked if I can recommend a person to the College of
Surgeons, whose duty will be to attend upon the
Curators and Professors, and make preparations, and
do other work in Natural History. The salary is
£1 : 10s. a week. If such a thing will suit you, let me
know, and I will write to propose you. If the place
is not filled up, I think it might be got.”</p>

<p>This letter raised a glimmer of hope in Edward’s
breast. Was he really to be rewarded at last for his
efforts in Natural History, by an appointment which
would bring him into communication with scientific
men? It may be mentioned, that Edward had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
already been appointed keeper of the Scientific Society’s
museum at Banff, at a salary of £2 : 2s. per annum. This
was of course merely a nominal remuneration, and
the occupation did not tend to feed Edward’s thirst
for further knowledge in Natural History. He was
therefore most willing to accede to Mr. Bate’s proposition;
and he sent in his application, accompanied
by testimonials, to Professor Quekett of the Royal
College of Surgeons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S DISAPPOINTMENT.</i></div>

<p>Unfortunately Mr. Bate had been misinformed as
to the nature of the proposed appointment. “I am
fearful,” said Professor Quekett, in his letter to
Edward, “that some of your kind friends have misinformed
you as to the nature of the appointment
which is vacant. It is only that of fourth museum
porter. The duties are: to keep the room clean, dust
bottles, etc., at the wage of a guinea a week. Now,
from what I learn of you through your testimonials,
and from what I have heard of your reputation
and high standing as a Naturalist, I think such an
appointment is far beneath your notice.”</p>

<p>Edward’s hopes were once more blighted. Science
could do nothing for him, and he returned once more
to his cobbler’s stool. He had become accustomed to
disappointment; nevertheless he continued to pursue
his work as a Naturalist. In fact, he went on working
harder than before. As Mr. Bate was only engaged
with one branch of the Crustacea—the Sessile-eyed,—and
as other Naturalists were engaged in investigating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
other branches of Marine Zoology, Edward was referred
to these gentlemen,—more particularly to the
Rev. A. Merle Norman of Sedgefield, Ferryhill, county
of Durham; Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys of London; and Mr.
Joshua Alder of Newcastle-on-Tyne,—all of whom
were great sea-dredgers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ZOOLOGISTS.</i></div>

<p>Zoologists usually take up some special subject
and work it up. They freely correspond with their
fellow-zoologists in different parts of the country with
the object of obtaining their help,—which is rarely or
never withheld. There is a sort of freemasonry
amongst Naturalists in this respect. Thus, when
Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys opened his correspondence with
Edward, he said, “No introduction can be necessary
from one Naturalist to another.” While artists and
literary men form themselves into cliques, and cut
each other up in social circles and in newspapers,
Naturalists, on the contrary, seem to be above such
considerations of envy and uncharitableness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REV. A. M. NORMAN.</i></div>

<p>There is also a fellow-feeling amongst them, and
they are ready to help each other in various other
ways. Thus, when Edward was informed by Mr.
Spence Bate that the Rev. Mr. Norman was working
up the British Entomostracous Crustacea, including
the Fish Parasites, Edward immediately began to
scour the coast, and wade along the waves as the
tide came in, plunging into the rock-pools, in order to
procure the animals of which Mr. Norman was in
search. He did this, regardless of his health, and also
regardless of his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>A long correspondence had already taken place
between Edward and Mr. Norman; but, in the midst
of it, Edward was again laid up by illness, which lasted
for about six weeks. The correspondence dropped
for a time; but it was afterwards renewed. Mr.
Norman, in his letter of May 12th, 1862, observed,
“I have been absent from home ever since I received
your last note, or I should have answered it before.
I am extremely sorry to hear of the cause, your
serious illness, which prevented your answering my
two last letters, and seemed to end a correspondence
from which I had derived so much pleasure,—finding
in yourself such a kindred, nature-loving spirit. I am
rejoiced, however, that God has mercifully raised you
up again after so much suffering, and that you are
recovering the blessings of health and strength.</p>

<p>“Many thanks for the promise of your kind offices
for me in procuring Fish Parasites. Our knowledge
of them is at present but limited, and a large number
of species new to our Fauna, may, I am satisfied, be
found, if properly looked after. I trust, therefore, that
you may extend your knowledge of the Crustacea of
the Moray Firth to this branch of the subject.”</p>

<p>It would occupy too much space to detail the
contents of the letters which Edward received from
Mr. Norman and Mr. Spence Bate while their respective
works were in process of publication. But
there are several facts in them worthy of being noticed.
There was one Crustacean about which some difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
had arisen. It was the <i>Mysis spinifera</i>, which
Edward had first found in the Moray Firth in the
year 1858. He had sent it to one of his correspondents,
in order that he might give it its name. But it
remained unnoticed and unknown for a period of
about four years, when it was re-discovered in Sweden
by M. Goes, who at once published the fact. “Thus,”
says Edward, “the first finder, as well as the country
in which this Crustacean was first found, have both
been ignored in the records of science.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW SPECIES DISCOVERED.</i></div>

<p>Edward discovered many new species, some of
which had never been met with before, and others
which had not been met with in Britain. Some
were recognised and named, but others were not.
“The number of specimens I collected,” says Edward,
“was immense. It must have been so from the
various methods I adopted to procure them, and
from the fact that I never lost a single opportunity
of obtaining even but one object when it could
be got. Labour, time, cold, wet, privation, were
nothing, so that I could but secure the specimen that
I sought for.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are still several new species
which I discovered and sent to gentlemen years
ago. All I knew about them, from letters I received
in return, is that they were <i>new</i>; but whether they
have ever received names, or whether the discoveries
have been made public, I do not know.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VIBILIA BOREALIS.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Spence Bate did every justice to Edward in
the discoveries which he made of <i>new species</i>, in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
with his branch of the Sessile-eyed Crustacea.
In one case, Edward caught only the anterior
moiety of a small Crustacean (<i>Protomedeia hirsutimana</i>),
and yet Mr. Bate includes it in his list, and
gives a drawing of it. Mr. Bate also did every justice
to the accurate, description of the habits of the species
which Edward forwarded to him. For instance,
Edward discovered the <i>Vibilia borealis</i>, a new
species, in the Moray Firth, on which Mr. Spence
Bate observes—</p>

<p>“Hitherto the species of this genus have been
taken only as pelagic, in tropical or sub-tropical latitudes.
It is an interesting fact that this species
should have been taken off the coast of Banff, from
whence it was sent us by that very successful observer
Mr. Edward, who, in writing, says: ‘I can
say little as to its habits. I took eleven, and kept a
few alive for a short time, but observed nothing in
their manners beyond that which may be seen in the
majority of species. I supplied them with plenty of
sand, and also with a few marine plants, but they
neither seemed to be burrowers nor climbers, as they
never went into the one nor appeared to care for the
other. They, however, swam a little. This they do
somewhat after the manner of <i>Callisoma crenata</i>; in
other words, they rise gradually from the bottom until
they reach the top; then, putting on more power, they
swim round and round the vessel. With close observation
I observed that the superior antennæ were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
pretty well up, and very widely apart, whereas the
inferior were always directed downwards. All the
legs were kept doubled up. I never saw them
stretched out. They would then sink once more to
the sand at the bottom. There they would rest sometimes
for a few minutes, sometimes longer, when they
would again repeat their voluntary evolutions. They
did not, however, always rise to the surface. The
journey was sometimes performed to about mid-water.
They are, when alive, a most beautiful coloured
species, variegated not unlike <i>Urothroë elegans</i>, and
rivalling that animal in brightness of tints. I took
one, however, that was all over a most brilliant red.
I have been told that this species has never been
found outside the Medusa. However this may be,
all mine were. And what appears to be most extraordinary
is, that we have had no Medusæ here this
season.” Edward found another species, new to
Britain, <i>Themisto Crassicornis</i>, which exist in large
quantities in July, August, and September. Mr.
Bate says, “Mr. Edward informs us that he has seen
specimens of these Crustaceans thrown on shore in
extraordinarily large quantities. After a storm one
night he saw them forming a band an inch and a
half deep for thirty yards along the beach.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S CLOSE OBSERVATION.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Bate so much admired Edward’s enthusiasm
in the cause of Natural History, that he more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
once urged him to publish his observations: “I received
from you,” he says, “a few days since, a parcel
of <i>Eurydice pulchra</i>, in sand, one of which only was
alive. I have been much interested in watching its
active habits, and the manner in which it buries itself
in the sand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish that you would write some
papers on the habits of these creatures. Keep a few
at home under as favourable conditions as possible.
I am sure much is yet to be learnt about them. I
know no one better fitted to work out the subject
than yourself. For instance, get some of the <i>Podocerus
capillatus</i>, and find out how it spins the web
that makes the nest; and closely watch all their
ways.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S DIFFICULTIES.</i></div>

<p>Edward might no doubt have written and published
many papers in the scientific journals. He might have
gained praise, fame, and honour. But what mattered
these to him? The principal thing that he wanted was
time—time not only for his investigations, but to earn
money for the maintenance of his family. He had now
a wife and eleven children to support. He earned
nothing by science: he earned everything by his
shoemaker’s awl. What could the <i>Podocerus capillatus</i>
do for his family? Nothing whatever! His entire
labours were gratuitous. Properly speaking, Naturalists
should be gentlemen of independent fortune.
At all events, they should have some profession to live
by; whilst Edward had nothing but his wretchedly-paid
trade of shoemaking. The wonder is, that, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
all his illnesses, arising for the most part from the
results of exposure, he should have done so much,
and continued his self-sacrificing investigations so
long. But he seems to have been borne up throughout
by his scientific enthusiasm, and by his invincible
determination.</p>

<div class="caption">NESTS OF NEST-BUILDING CRUSTACEA.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEST-BUILDING CRUSTACEA.</i></div>

<p>The <i>Podocerus capillatus</i>, to which Mr. Bate repeatedly
directed Edward’s attention, is a very interesting
Crustacean. It is about a quarter of an inch
long. It is beautifully variegated, and builds its
nests in a very bird-like manner in submarine
forests. Edward found it in the rock-pools off Banff,
where it built its nests on <i>Corallina officinalis</i>. The
nest consists chiefly of a fine thread-like material
woven and interlaced. The form of the nest is somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
oval, the entrance being invariably at the top.
“These nests,” says Mr. Bate, “are evidently used as
a place of refuge and security, in which the parent
protects and keeps her brood of young until they are
old enough to be independent of the mother’s care.”
The accompanying illustration is taken from Messrs.
Bate and Westwood’s book. In this case, the nests
were built in Plumularia, off Polperro, Cornwall.</p>

<p>A few extracts from Mr. Norman’s and Mr. Bate’s
letters will serve to show the numerous new species
which Edward continued to forward to these eminent
zoologists.</p>

<p>Mr. Norman (September 24, 1862) writes: “The
Mysis I referred to in my last letter is undescribed;
and I propose to call it <i>Mysis longicornis</i>. Might I
be allowed to keep the specimen? I retain it at any
rate for the present, in order to draw up a description
and figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW SPECIES FOUND.</i></div>

<p>“I have made a most important discovery since I
last wrote. On looking again at the specimens (of
the Parasites taken by Edward from the Sun-fish)
I find that I had confused two species together as
<i>Læmargus muricatus</i>, and had passed by as the male
of that species (looking at them only with the naked
eye) a distinct species, which is <i>new</i> to Britain, and
which I am at present unable to name.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SHRIMPS AND PARASITES.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Norman wrote again (January 3, 1863):
“Thanks for the Hyperia, which belongs to a different
species to those you previously sent me. At present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
I cannot name them. The Annelid—a very curious
fellow—I know nothing of. I will name the Sea-spider
<i>Nymphon</i>. The treasure of the bottle was,
however, the little white shrimp. It is <i>new</i> to
Britain, and possibly to science. We will call it, at
any rate for the present, <i>Thysanopoda ensifera</i>, New
Species. The genus is a very interesting one, and only
one species, <i>Thysanopoda couchii</i>, was previously
known in our seas.”</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Norman wrote to Edward:
“I gladly accept your suggestion that the Thysanopoda
should be called <i>T. Batei</i> (instead of <i>ensifera</i>),
and I am as glad as you are to pay the compliment
to Mr. Bate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your observations on the habits of
the Thysanopoda are very interesting.”</p>

<p>Edward evidently supplied his correspondent with
abundant examples, for, on the 27th of January 1863,
Mr. Norman writes: “The parasite on the fin is
<i>Anchorella rugosa</i>—not a common species. I hope
you will procure more. The <i>Pagurus cuanensis</i> bore
on its back an example of a highly interesting genus
of parasitic Crustacea, <i>Peltogaster</i>. The specimens do
not belong to the species hitherto recognised in our
seas; perhaps they are still undescribed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bate also wrote to Edward during the same
month of January: “I think that your last long-legged
shrimp may be a new genus. If so, I propose
calling it <i>Polledactylos</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are other things
of much interest also. Do try what you can do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the way of collecting specimens of the young of
crabs, etc. Your species of <i>Stenothoë clypeatus</i> is new
to Britain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MORE SPECIMENS WANTED.</i></div>

<p>During the next few months Edward was in constant
communication with Mr. Bate and Mr. Norman,
who named for him an immense number of Crustacea.
Many of them were new to Britain; some of them
were new to science. On March 6th Mr. Bate writes:
“The little fellow was a <i>Pettidium purpureum</i>. The
long-legged Mysis are handsome chaps. The second
is, I think, <i>Œdiceros sasignatus</i>: if so, it is <i>the first</i>
taken in Britain.” Again, shortly after, Mr. Bate
asks, “Do you recollect a little fellow just like this?
[giving a diagram]. I never saw the like of it before.
Where did you get it? Do get me more! Is it a
wood-borer? I am afraid that you will scold me
when I tell you that I have not yet examined the
green bottle which you sent me previously. I am
just in the midst of describing a number of Crustacea
put into my hands, belonging to the Boundary Commission
between America and British Columbia.
When I finish this work I will write to you again.”</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Bate examines the green
bottle, and writes a letter to Edward, in which he
gives him the names of seventeen Crustacea which it
contained. Mr. Bate was as voracious for further
discoveries, as Edward himself was. In a letter
of 10th December 1863, after giving an account
of the various works on which he was engaged, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
says: “Now, because I am working hard in the path
that you love so well and labour so industriously in,
and so adding to your own fame, do not say that I
don’t deserve the results of your researches.”</p>

<p>Fame! that “imagined life in the breath of others”!
What could fame do for poor Edward? What about
his bread and cheese?</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the letter last mentioned did
not at first reach Edward. It was re-posted by Mr.
Bate, with the observation, “This has just come back
to me as a returned letter, because Banff was unknown
at the Post-office.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PUZZLING SHRIMPS.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Norman also continued to furnish Edward
with the names of his various Crustacea, though he
could not name some of them. For instance, on the
13th May 1863, he wrote to Edward: “The shrimps
you have sent completely puzzle me. I must wait for
a time until I can solve the mystery. I believe that
they all belong to one species, yet there are three, if
not four, distinct forms. The general characters are
so much the same, that I cannot think there are two
species.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the curious thing is, that I have
not yet seen a single specimen of the species carrying
eggs. I hope that you will yet find some, as it will
be most interesting to clear up not only the question
of sex, but also to find out the manner in which the
eggs are carried. These forms are amongst the most
interesting things I have seen for a long time, because
it would almost seem as though we had a Crustacean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with three phases, just as the bee has—male, female,
and worker.” After giving a number of names, Mr.
Norman proceeds: “And lastly, the parasite from
the Common Gurnard is a species <i>new</i> to Britain.”</p>

<p>In his next letter Mr. Norman informs Edward
that he is again going to Shetland on a dredging
expedition with his friend Mr. Jeffreys. They are to
go in a steamer, and “ought to do good work.” How
Edward envied them—going dry-footed, well fed,
well-clad, and in a steamer,—while he was working
along shore, with no tools, but his hands and his
bag-net.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ZOOLOGISTS IN ECSTASIES.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Norman returned from Shetland in July, and
immediately recommenced his correspondence with
Edward. “One of your shrimps,” he said, “is
<i>Caligus isonyx</i>, <i>new</i> to our Fauna, and a very interesting
one it is. The male is as yet unknown. I
hope you may succeed in meeting with it.” Towards
the end of the year Edward forwarded a number of
species new to Britain,—amongst others <i>Eurycercus
hamellatus</i> (obtained from the stomach of the perch),
<i>Chondracantha solex</i>, <i>Mysis mixta</i>, and others. In
one bottle of Crustaceans <i>three new species</i> were
found. The zoologists were evidently in ecstasies.
Mr. Norman exhibited the results of his researches at
the next meeting of the British Association. In a
letter, dated the 15th September 1863, he observed:
“I enclose a list of <i>fifteen</i> Moray Firth Amphipoda,
which you have found, and which are unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
me. If you now, or at any future time, should be
able to favour me with specimens of any of them, I
shall be extremely obliged.” The specimens were
afterwards sent to Mr. Norman.</p>

<p>On the 6th of February 1864 Mr. Bate wrote to
Edward: “You will be glad to learn that your little
specimen is <i>Opis Essichtii</i>, and that it has not been
found previously in Britain. I have reconsidered the
little Hyperia, and think that you are right; your remarks
convince me that my first opinion was the
more correct. You will therefore call it <i>Hyperia
Medusarum</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SESSILE-EYED CRUSTACEA.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Bate was then publishing in parts his work
on <i>The Sessile-eyed Crustacea</i>. He sent Edward
the several parts as they appeared. About the beginning
of 1855 Mr. Bate says: “You will soon get
a new part of Crustacea, and then you will find that
all my time and attention has been occupied with
the Isopods. So <i>do</i> try and look out for some of
these, and leave the Amphipods alone for a little
while.”</p>

<p>And again: “Please never apologise for writing
to me about Natural History. We have now been
such long correspondents, that unless I hear from you
now and then, I begin to fancy myself forgotten.
Your letters always give me pleasure. The crustacean
that you speak of is a <i>Vibilia</i>, the <i>first</i> taken in the
British Islands. Please let me know its habitat, and
as much of its habits as you can.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Norman was appealing to
him for specimens of the Echinoderms, as he was
about to prepare a paper on the subject. “I want
your aid,” he said; “I know you will kindly give it
me. The <i>Urothoes</i> are extremely difficult, and I
want specimens from as many parts of the coast as
possible, of all varieties and sizes, and from all depths
of water. Will you collect for me some from your
neighbourhood, from young to the largest size of all
you can meet with, keeping distinct those from the
shore and those from the deep water? It is important
that they should be well preserved.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Please get
the specimens as soon as possible, and send them to
me by rail.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S INDUSTRY.</i></div>

<p>Edward obeyed the behests of his several correspondents.
He searched the rock pools, fished with
his bag-net along the shore, and found various new
specimens, which he sent to his friends. But he
could not find the Echinodermata in deep water, for
he had no means of reaching them. He had no boat,
no dredging apparatus. Perhaps his correspondents
forgot—perhaps they never knew—that he was a
poor hard-working man, labouring at his trade during
the day, with only a few hours in the early morning
and a few hours at night, which he was able to employ
in their service.</p>

<p>Not only did he work for his correspondents so
industriously, but he also worked for others to whom
they referred him. Thus Mr. Norman desired him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to send his Sponges to Mr. Bowerbank, and his
Ascidians to Mr. Alder of Newcastle, who were engaged
in working up these subjects. The investigators
did not know—for none of them ever saw
him—that Edward had the greatest difficulty in
earning money enough to maintain his large family.
Sometimes, in fact, he was on the brink of starvation.
And yet he worked for his naturalist friends as willingly
and as hardly, perhaps more hardly, than if he
had been a gentleman of independent fortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. BATE’S EULOGIUMS.</i></div>

<p>When the <i>History of the Sessile-eyed Crustacea</i>
came out, the assistance which had been rendered by
Edward to Mr. Bate was fully and generously acknowledged.
Let any one look over the book, and he
will find of how much service Edward was to Mr.
Bate while he was preparing the work for publication.
Mr. Bate frequently speaks of Edward as “our
valued, able, and close observer.” In addition to the
references to Edward already mentioned, we may
subjoin the following. In speaking of the <i>Lysianassa
longicornus</i>, Mr. Bate says that it “has been forwarded
to him by that obliging and indefatigable
naturalist, Mr. Edward of Banff;” that his only specimen
of <i>Anonyx obesus</i> has been sent to him by Mr.
Edward; that the <i>Phoxus Holbelli</i> has been sent to
him from Banff “by that indefatigable lover of nature,
Mr. Edward;” that the species of <i>Darwinia compressa</i>
was first taken by Mr. Edward at the entrance to the
Moray Firth; that the first species of the <i>Calliope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Ossiani</i> had been received from Mr. Edward, “from
which specimen the original description in the catalogue
in the British Museum has been drawn up.”
Mr. Bate also stated that he only knew of the genus
Eurisus through an imperfect specimen which had
been taken by Mr. Edward in the Moray Firth, “the
first and only British representative of the genus that
we have seen.” So too with the genus Protomedia,
of which “only two specimens were collected at Banff
by Mr. Edward.” A moiety was obtained of the first
species, which was called <i>Protomedia hirsutimana</i>.
In the second case, the entire Crustacean was obtained,
of which Mr. Bate made a drawing and description,
and he named it <i>Protomedia Whitei</i>, “in compliment
to Mr. Adam White, author of a popular history of
the British Crustacea.” Only a single specimen of
the <i>Cratippus tenuipes</i> was sent him by Mr. Edward,
who knew nothing of its habits. Mr. Bate also stated
that he “had only seen three specimens of the <i>Phoxus
fusticaudatus</i>, which were discovered by his valued
correspondent, Mr. Edward of Banff, attached to the
brachiæ of the common Soldier Crab.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S DISCOVERIES.</i></div>

<p>Besides these discoveries, Edward found an immense
variety of Crustaceans of other orders in the
Moray Firth, which had never been found before.
Some of these were new to Britain, some of them new
to science. But we will not bewilder the reader by
introducing the jaw-breaking names of the newly-discovered
Crustaceans. We have thought it right, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to mention a few of those introduced in Messrs.
Bate and Westwood’s <i>History of the Sessile-eyed
Crustacea</i>, for the purpose of confirming the statements
which we have made as to the indefatigable
enthusiasm of Edward in the pursuit of Natural History.
It must also be mentioned that the Sessile-eyed
Crustacea constitute only a single order, and
that on the one side of them there are the Stalk-eyed
Crustacea and on the other the Entomostraceous
Crustacea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FLOATING MEDUSA.</i></div>

<p>There is one point, however, that must be referred
to before we conclude this heavy chapter. The impression
prevailed at one time that the Hyperiidæ
were parasites of the Medusa or Jelly Fish. In 1862
Mr. Bate acknowledged the receipt of a Crustacean,
which he denominated <i>Hyperia medusarum</i>. He
said, “If I am correct, this is the first time that I
have known it as British.” In a subsequent letter
(23d December 1863), Mr. Bate said, “It is an interesting
circumstance that you should have found the
Hyperia and Lestrigonus free on the shore; inasmuch
as they have previously only been known as inhabitants
of the floating Medusa. I wish you would direct
your attention further to the subject.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hunt and
be successful.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Norman also communicated with
Edward about the same time, and informed him
“that the Atylus is not a parasitical species, though
there <i>are</i> some Crustacea (Hyperia) which are parasitical
upon Medusa.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW CRUSTACEA FOUND.</i></div>

<p>Upon further investigation, Edward came to the
conclusion that the Hyperia is no more the parasite of
the Medusa, because it is sometimes found upon it,—than
a crow is the parasite of a tree because it sometimes
lights upon it. As Edward’s name was now
frequently quoted in matters of Zoology, he thought
that it might be of some use to give the results of his
observations to the world on the subject. Hence the
appearance of his “Stray Notes on some of the
Smaller Crustaceans,” which shortly after appeared
in the Journal of the Linnean Society.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the facts in that paper, as stated
by Edward, had some influence on the minds of Professor
Westwood and Mr. Spence Bate; as <i>Hyperia
medusarum</i> does not appear in their list of Sessile-eyed
Crustacea, the last part of which was published
at the end of 1868.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the indefatigable industry of
Edward in his researches among the Crustaceans, it
may be mentioned, that of 294 found in the Moray
Firth, not fewer than <i>twenty-six new species</i> were
added by Edward himself!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small><i>DISCOVERIES AMONGST ZOOPHYTES,
MOLLUSCS, AND FISHES.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the same time that Edward was occupied in
searching out new species of Crustaceans for Mr.
Spence Bate and Mr. Norman, he was also collecting
marine objects for other naturalists. He found
numerous Star-fish, Zoophytes, Molluscs, and Sponges,
which he sent to his naturalist correspondents to be
named.</p>

<p>Edward always endeavoured to bring home the
fishes, crustaceans, and other sea objects that he captured,
alive; for the purpose of watching their manners
and habits. He had always plenty of dishes
in readiness, filled with sea-water,—some having
sand on the bottom, some mud, some bits of gravel,
and others bits of rock,—the latter being covered
with Algæ or Zoophytes. Into one of these vessels
he would put his living specimens, in order that he
might watch and learn something of their various
characteristics. Some of his observations were published
in the <i>Zoologist</i>, and were regarded as highly
interesting; many of them being new to science.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>This could hardly have been otherwise, for it was
his habit, first to <i>observe</i>, and then to kill. He never
had any mercenary object in view in wandering
about with his gun and his traps; he only desired
to obtain knowledge; and what he observed he told
as plainly and clearly as he could, without knowing
whether his observations had been printed before
or not. He only regretted that he had so little
time to publish his descriptions of the habits of
animals, fishes, and crustaceans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STAR-FISH.</i></div>

<p>One of Edward’s most delightful studies was that
of the Star-fish. He published an article on the subject
in the <i>Zoologist</i>. His object in doing so, he said,
was to induce others to employ their spare time in
discovering the Star-fishes found along the Banffshire
coast, and to make them publicly known. “If this,”
said he, “were done generally throughout the country,
we might, ere long, be able to form something
like an adequate notion of what we really do possess;
but until that be done, we cannot expect to arrive at
anything like a perfect idea of what our British Fauna
consists of, or where the objects are to be found. Let
Naturalists then, and observers of Nature everywhere,
look to and note this, that all who can may reap the
benefit.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BRITTLE STARS.</i></div>

<p>Edward was as enthusiastic about the Star-fish as
he was about any other form of animated being. He
would allow none of them to be called “common.”
They were all worthy of the most minute investigation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and also worthy of the deepest admiration. Of
the Daisy Brittle Stars (<i>Ophiocoma bellis</i>) he says:
“They are the most beautiful of this beautiful tribe
which I have ever seen. Their disks differ considerably
from the Star-fishes ordinarily met with, being
of a pyramidal or conical form, sometimes resembling
the well-known shell <i>Trochus tumidus</i>. In colour,
they are like the finest variegated polished mahogany;
their disks exhibiting the most beautiful carved
work. The rays are short in proportion to the size
of the disk—strong, and closely beset with short,
thick, hard spines. I may add that the specimens I
allude to, were procured from that heterogeneous repository
of marine objects, the stomach of a cod,
which was taken about thirteen miles out at sea.”</p>

<p>Edward’s children also helped him to procure
Star-fishes. “I remember,” he says, “my young friend
Maggie, and three of her sisters, once bringing me a
large cargo of the Granulated Brittle Star (<i>Ophiocoma
granulata</i>)—nearly two hundred of them, which
they had gathered up where the fishermen clean their
lines. I remember being particularly struck with the
numerous and brilliant colours displayed by the cargo,
exhibiting, as they did, all those tints—perhaps more
than it is possible to name—from the brightest scarlet
down to the deepest black, scarcely two being
alike. Their disks, too, were remarkably varied;
some were of a perfect oval, whilst others were pentangular;
some were flat, whilst others were in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
measure pyramidal, and what, in truth, may be
termed triangular in form.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW STAR-FISH.</i></div>

<p>Of all his daughters, Maggie seems to have been
the most helpful. She went down to Gardenston to
obtain the refuse from the fishermen’s lines, to collect
fish, crustacea, and such like, and send them home to
her father by the carrier. She sometimes accompanied
him along the coast as far as Fraserburgh and
Peterhead. One evening, while Edward was partaking
of his evening meal, Maggie entered and accosted
him joyfully—“Father, I’ve got a new Star-fish t’ ye,
wi’ sax legs!” “I hope so, Maggie,” he answered,
“but I doubt it.” After he had finished his
supper, he said, “Now, Maggie, let’s see this prodigy
of yours.” After looking at it, “Just as I thought,
Maggie,” said he, “it’s <i>not</i> a new species—it’s only an
<i>Ophiocoma Ballii</i>, but rather a peculiar one in its way,
having, as you said, ‘sax legs’ instead of five.”</p>

<p>Of the Rosy-Feather Star (<i>Comatula roseacea</i>)—which
Edward had long been searching for, and at last
found—he says: “What a pretty creature! but how
brittle! and oh, how beautiful! Does any one wonder,
as I used to do, when he hears of a stone-lily or
of a lily-star, as applied to this genus? Then let him
get a sight of a Crenard-star, and sure I am that his
surprise will give place to admiration. And how
curious! It was once supposed to have been the
’most numerous of the ocean’s inhabitants,’ whereas
now there are only about a dozen kinds to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
alive,—one only in the British seas, and that but
rarely met with. Well, I am proud to be able to
record its occurrence on the Banffshire coast. The
specimen I allude to, was taken from the stomach of
a cod.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GREAT SEA-CUCUMBER.</i></div>

<p>But still more wonderful is that rare species, the
Great Sea-Cucumber (<i>Cucumaria frondosa</i>), the king
of the Holothuridæ family, found on the Banffshire
coast. Edward’s specimen was brought up on
the fishermen’s lines. “When at rest,” he says, “it
is fully sixteen inches long. It is of a very deep
purple on all except the under side, which is greyish.
It is a most wonderful, and at the same time a most
interesting animal. What strange forms and curious
shapes it assumes at will! Now it seems like a pear,
and again like a large purse or long pudding. Sometimes
it has the appearance of two monster potatoes
joined endways,—from which it diverges into a single
bulb, with no suckers visible; and again it looks as
long as my arm, rough and warty-looking. Its tentacula
too, how curious they are! Simple to appearance,
yet how complete and how beautiful withal.
What strange forms and what beauteous creatures
and inconceivable things there are in the ocean’s
depths! What a pity it is that we cannot traverse
its hidden fields and explore its untrodden caverns!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEAD-MAN’S PAPS.</i></div>

<p>Edward found numerous Zoophytes along the
coast, which excited his admiration almost as much
as the Star-fish. Of one species, called “dead-men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
paps, sea-fingers, etc.” (<i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>), he says,
“It is frequently brought ashore by the fishermen,
attached to shells and stones. It is curious to observe
the strange and fantastic forms which these creatures
at times assume. They are loathed by the generality
of people when found on the sands. But were they
to be seen in their proper element, with the beautiful
leaf-like tentacula of the little polyps, thousands
of which compose the living mass, these feelings of
loathing would give place to wonder and delight.
Touch one of those polyps, and it instantly contracts
and withdraws its tentacles, while the others continue
their movements. But touch them again and again,
and they will shrink and hide themselves in their
fleshy home, which becomes greatly reduced in bulk.
Wait a little, and you will observe the pap assume
its natural size, and the surface will appear roughish
and covered with small protuberances. From these
asperities the numerous polyps may now be noticed,
slowly, and almost imperceptibly, emerging one by
one; and having gained a sufficient height, their
slender and fragile arms, or tentacula, will also be
observed cautiously expanding, which, when nearly
fully developed, gives to the whole mass the enchanting
appearance of a bouquet of flowers of the
richest dye, or of a gaudy-coloured wreath of beautiful
and delicate blossoms, combined in one cluster,
enough to excite wonder and admiration even in
the dullest mind.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ASCIDIANS.</i></div>

<p>Without following Edward farther in his description
of the Zoophytes, we may proceed to state that
he was for some time engaged in collecting Molluscs
for Mr. Alder of Newcastle, who was engaged in
writing a paper on the subject. Having observed
the great number of Tunicata, or acephalous Molluscs,
found upon the fishermen’s lines, Edward proceeded
to collect and examine these lower productions
of marine life. As usual, he wished to have
them named, and he sent a large number of specimens
to Mr. Alder for the purpose. Some of Mr. Alder’s
letters have been preserved, from which a few extracts
are subjoined:—</p>

<p>“I have received yours of the 16th inst. (October
1864), and also two parcels of Ascidians. I shall be
most happy to receive and name for you any Tunicata
you may send. Our communications may be mutually
advantageous, as I should like to have information
concerning the Tunicata of your coast, being
engaged upon a work on the British species. In the
first parcel that came, I could only find one specimen,
though you mention parts of two or three. It was, I
think, a Botryllida encrusting the stem of a seaweed,
but of what species I cannot say. In the second parcel,
received this morning, there is a piece of <i>Leptoclinum
punctatum</i>, and also part of an Ascidian which appears
to be <i>A. parallelogramma</i>. The Botryllida are very
difficult to distinguish unless they are quite fresh. I
have never heard of <i>Aplidium lobatum</i> being found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in this country. It is a Red Sea and Mediterranean
species.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am much obliged to my friend
Mr. Norman for recommending you to send specimens
to me, and I shall be glad to hear from you again.”</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>Aplidium lobatum</i> which Edward
sent to Mr. Alder, was cast ashore at Banff; though
its usual habitat is the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea,
and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In a future letter Mr. Alder says: “I received
your box containing a specimen of <i>Ascidia sordida</i>
(young), and also a Zoophyte, the <i>Alcyonidium gelatinosum</i>,
for which accept my thanks. I see that you
have been very successful in discovering small fish.
Your account of them is very interesting. I wish
any one on our coast would pay attention to these
things, but we have no one living permanently on
the coast that cares anything about Natural History.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WANT OF OBSERVERS.</i></div>

<p>Edward afterwards discovered a fine specimen of
the <i>Onychoteuthes Bartlingii</i> or <i>Banksii</i>. It was the
first met with in Britain,—the range of the species
being said to be from Norway to the Cape and
Indian Ocean. This specimen was found on the
beach betwixt the mouth of the river Deveron and
the town of Macduff. Doubtless many other specimens
of this and other marine animals had been cast
upon the beach before, but no one had taken the
trouble to look for or observe them. Many, also, of
the fishes and marine objects which Edward was the
first to discover, had probably been haunting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Moray Firth for hundreds or thousands of years; but
science had not yet been born in the district, and
there were none who had the seeing eye and the
observant faculties of our Banffshire Naturalist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANOTHER DISCOVERY.</i></div>

<p>Edward also discovered a specimen of the <i>Leptoclinum
punctatum</i> which had been thrown on shore
during a severe storm. It was of a most beautiful
greenish colour, variegated with steel blue. This
specimen he sent to Mr. Alder, who answered him in
the following letter:—“The Ascidian which you have
sent me is a Leptoclinum, and may probably be a new
species. There are few of that genus with star-shaped
calcareous crystals embedded in them. The species that
you have sent has the star-shaped crystals, and differs in
colour from any I have seen, being of a greenish-blue
colour. I put it into water to moisten it after it came,
and it stained the water of a blue colour. I presume,
therefore, that it would be of that colour when fresh.
It seems, from the seaweed to which it is attached,
to be a littoral species. I shall be glad of any other
information which you can give me about it.”</p>

<p>This was the last letter Edward received from Mr.
Alder. As he was about to send off another large
cargo of Tunicata to Newcastle, containing three new
species, he received notice of Mr. Alder’s sudden
death; and knowing of no other person who could
name his Ascidians, he ceased collecting them;
although there is still a rich field for students of
Mollusca along the Banffshire coast. “It is young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
ardent, and devoted workers,” said Edward, “that are
wanted to bring such things to light.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. COUCH OF POLPERRO.</i></div>

<p>We next proceed to mention Edward’s researches
as to new fishes. Having discovered a specimen of
Drummond’s Echiodon—the first that had ever been
found in the Firth,—Edward published an account of
it in the <i>Zoologist</i> for April 1863, and offered to afford
Naturalists the opportunity of examining it. The
article came under the notice of Mr. Jonathan Couch,
of Polperro, in Cornwall, who was then engaged in
writing his celebrated work on British Fishes; and
he entered into a correspondence with Edward on the
subject. The first letter that Mr. Couch wrote to
Edward did not reach him. It was returned to Polperro.
Banff seems not to have been known at the
General Post Office. Another letter, with “N. B.”
added, reached its address. Mr. Couch requested
an inspection of the curious fish, together with an
account of its exact colour when fresh from the sea,
and also the particular circumstances, of weather
or otherwise, under which so large a number of
the fishes had been taken. The information asked
for, was at once furnished by Edward. Dr. Gray
also requested a specimen for the British Museum,
which was forwarded to London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WRASSES.</i></div>

<p>Now that Edward had found another opening for
his discoveries, he proceeded to send numerous new
specimens of fish for Mr. Couch’s identification. Mr.
Couch having informed him that he was then employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
upon the Wrasses, Edward immediately began
to search for Wrasses, and shortly after he despatched
numbers of them to Polperro. Among the specimens
of Wrass (<i>labrus</i>) which Edward sent to Mr. Couch,
there was one which Cuvier described as being found
only in New Guinea, on the farther side of the
world. “And yet,” said Mr. Couch, after examining
the fish, “I cannot suppose that fishes from New
Guinea can have visited you.” The finding of this
fish at New Guinea and at the Moray Firth furnished
only another illustration of the scarcity of observers
in Natural History; for it must certainly, like most
other species, have existed in numerous other parts
of the world besides these.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A JUMPING WRASSE.</i></div>

<p>In describing his little fish, Edward says:
“Although I cannot say much of importance concerning
the traits of our little friend, still there is
one which cannot be passed over in silence. It is
this—on coming out of the water after I took the
prize, I had occasion to lay it down upon the sand
until a bottle was prepared for its reception and
exclusive use, as I was anxious to take it home
alive, so that I might see and learn as much of its
habits as possible. Whilst thus employed, I was
rather surprised at seeing it frequently leap several
inches at a time. Thinking that the damp sand
might have in some way or other aided the operation,
when I got home I placed it on a dry board to see how
it would perform there. It did just the same. Away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
it jumped, jump after jump, until I was fully satisfied
that there was no difference as to place; after
which I put him again into his little aquarium. I
now observed, however, that the tail, which is pretty
large, was the chief and most important object used.
The head and shoulders were first raised a little, and
then, by a doubling of the tail, which acted as a kind
of spring, the animal was, by a slight jerk, enabled to
raise and propel itself forward, or to either side, and
not unfrequently right over. In the water, too, when
touched with anything, instead of swimming away as
fish generally do, it merely leaped or jerked to one
side in order to avoid the annoyance. I am not
exactly aware whether this gymnastic performance
is a common propensity with this family of fishes or
not, but it was so with this specimen.”</p>

<p>After further observations, Edward came to the
conclusion that these little fishes were inhabitants
of our own seas, but that they differed from those
which Cuvier had described. He was of opinion that,
from the differences which he had observed between
the true Wrasses and the fish in question, it might
yet be necessary, after further investigation, to place
it in a <i>new</i> or <i>sub-genus</i>. In that case a portion of
the name would require to be changed, and until then,
Edward held that its name should be the “Microscopical
Wrasse of the Moray Firth.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NEW MIDGE.</i></div>

<p>Another batch of little fishes which Edward sent
to Mr. Couch led to an interesting correspondence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Edward no sooner found an opening for further work
on the sea-shore, than he went into it with enthusiasm.
As Mr. Couch was approaching the conclusion of
his work, Edward seemed to become more energetic
than before. Thus Mr. Couch had written out
and sent off his history and description of the
Echiodon to be printed, before he knew of Edward’s
discovery. And now there arrived from Banff
another batch of specimens, containing a little fish,
which Mr. Couch declared to be a <i>new species</i>,
and even a <i>new genus</i>. At first he supposed it
to be the Mackerel Midge, but after a careful
examination, he declared it to be entirely new. Mr.
Couch concluded his letter, containing his views as
to the new fish, with these words:—“You will perceive
that I set a great value on your communications,
and I shall take care to acknowledge them when
I speak of these different species.”</p>

<p>Edward, in his reply to Couch, observed: “I was
aware that the new fish was not the Mackerel Midge,
for I have examined it. But this is a far more splendid
species; in fact, its colours and resplendence equal,
if they do not excel, those of the pretty Argentine.
The one I sent you first, I kept alive for two days.
It was one of the most restless and watchful fishes I
had ever seen. I took it with a small hand-net,
which I use for taking the smaller crustaceans. I
only took one at first; but a few days after, I took
several together. I also found some cast ashore on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the sands. Those that I send now are old and young.
There is a little thing just out of the egg; it has the
ovary sac still attached. Be kind enough, when you
write me, to let me know the name of the fish.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COUCHIA THOMPSONI.</i></div>

<p>In replying to Edward, Couch said: “Your last
box has reached me, with its contents in good order,
for which I heartily thank you. I have already written
an account of the fish. My intention is to give
it the name of <i>Couchia Thompsoni</i>; and as I shall
particularly refer to you, I think it may prove to
your advantage to obtain as many specimens as possible,
to answer any demands that may be made upon
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The reason why I have not answered
you sooner is, that I have been much distressed by
the loss of my eldest son—an eminent surgeon, living
at Penzance, in attendance on whom I was at that
town for a fortnight. He was eminent in many departments
of science, and was only forty-six years of
age when he died. You may judge from this, that I
have had but little disposition to active exertion for
some time past. I submit, as he was able to do, to
the will of God, but there is difficulty in saying from
the heart, ‘His will be done.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW FISH.</i></div>

<p>Edward discovered the above new fish in May
1863. After a few weeks, it disappeared from the
coast, and nothing further was seen of it until the
following May, when Edward took a few specimens.
It disappeared again, and reappeared towards the end
of August. “As this,” he says, “was a lucky chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and one not to be lost, I took a considerable number,
not with the intention of destroying the beautiful
little creatures—as beautiful they truly are,—but for
the purpose of ascertaining how they now stood as to
size. Being satisfied as to this, I committed the most
of them again to their native element, and right glad
they were to be set once more at liberty. I found
that, although late in the season, they had not in any
way increased in bulk, as compared with those which
were taken in spring. From this important and opportune
circumstance, too, it is now my firm and
decided belief that their average length does not exceed
an inch. It would seem that they are a deep-water
fish, and, herring-like, only visit the shore
occasionally. Like that fish, too, they are gregarious—that
is, they go in small shoals. They seem to be
about the fleetest, most active, and most vigilant of
the finny tribes. Besides what I observed in the sea
itself, I kept a number of them alive, placed in the
window before me when at work, so that I had both
the pleasure as well as the satisfaction of observing
their habits at my leisure; and I was well repaid for
my time and patience.”</p>

<p>So soon as this discovery became known to the
scientific world, numerous inquiries were made to
Edward for specimens of the “New Fish;” and
amongst others, Dr. Gray sent for some specimens
for the Home Department of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Edward continued to ply Mr. Couch with new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
species of fish. On the 5th September 1864, he said:
“I herewith send you another small fish, which I
hope you will give me your opinion upon at your
leisure. I freely confess that I am at a loss about it.
Although small, it is so well proportioned in every
respect, so firm, and so compact, that I cannot believe
it to be a young specimen. I took it about a fortnight
since, in a small shoal of Thompson’s Midge;
and though I have been netting each day since then,
I have not yet met with another.”</p>

<p>Mr. Couch was equally at a loss with Edward.
At first he said, “It appears to be a <i>Wrass labrus</i>,
but it is not exactly like any of the known kinds.”
In his next letter he said, “I think your little fish
is the young of the Rock Goby.” This did not satisfy
Edward. He answered that “the fish, though little,
was a full-grown fish; and that it might possibly be
one of Thompson’s Irish fish.” “No,” replied Couch;
“it will be plain to you that it is not Irish from Mr.
Thompson’s own description,” which he then gave.
At last he thought it to be “the true Mackerel Midge.”
He examined the little fish again, and finally came to
the conclusion that it was a long-lost fish—Montagu’s
Midge, or the Silvery Gade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLONEL MONTAGU.</i></div>

<p>Colonel George Montagu was an old soldier and
sportsman, who had flourished in Devonshire some
seventy years before. Living in the country and by
the sea-shore, his attention was directed to the pursuit
of Natural History. At first it was his hobby, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
then it became his study. He observed birds carefully;
this was natural to him as a sportsman. He published
an <i>Ornithological Dictionary of British Birds</i>.
But his range of study broadened. The sea-shore
always presents a great attraction for Naturalists.
The sea is a wonderful nursery of nature. The
creatures that live in and upon it are so utterly
different from those which we meet with by land.
Then, everything connected with the ocean is full of
wonder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONTAGU’S CLOSE OBSERVATION.</i></div>

<p>Colonel Montagu was an extraordinary observer.
He was a man who possessed the <i>seeing</i> eye. He
forgot nothing that he once clearly saw. He was
one of the best Naturalists, so far as logical acumen
and earnest research were concerned, that England
has ever seen. The late Professor Forbes said of him
that “had he been educated a physiologist, and made
the study of Nature his aim and not his amusement,
his would have been one of the greatest names in the
whole range of British science. There is no question
about the identity of any animal that Montagu described.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He was a forward-looking philosopher;
he spoke of every creature as if one exceeding
like it, and yet different from it, would be washed up
by the waves next tide. Consequently his descriptions
are permanent.” We might also say of Edward,
that although comparatively uneducated, he possessed
precisely the same qualities of observing and seeing.
Nothing that once came under his eyes was forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
He remembered, and could describe fluently and
vividly, the form, habits, and habitats of the immense
variety of animals that came under his observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONTAGU’S MIDGE.</i></div>

<p>Now, this Colonel Montagu had in 1808 discovered
on the shore of South Devonshire the same Midge
that Edward rediscovered in 1864 on the shore of
the Moray Firth. Colonel Montagu had clearly and
distinctly described the fish in the second volume
of the <i>Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History
Society</i>; but he had not given any figure of it. He
named it the Silvery Gade (<i>Gadus argenteolus</i>). The
Colonel passed away, and with him all further notice
of his fish. It was never again observed until, fifty-six
years later, it was rediscovered by Edward.
Future writers on British fishes ignored it. They
believed that Colonel Montagu had been mistaken,
and had merely described the young of some species
already known. Even Mr. Couch, the most accomplished
ichthyologist of his time, had swept it out of
his list of British fishes. But Montagu was too
close an observer to be mistaken. As Professor
Forbes had said of him—“There is no question about
the identity of any animal that he described; consequently
his descriptions are permanent.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD ITS REDISCOVERER.</i></div>

<p>Hence the surprise of Mr. Couch on receiving from
Edward the identical fish that had so long been lost.
“There is one of your little fishes,” he said in his
reply to Edward’s letter, “that I am satisfied about,
and the history of which is a matter of much interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
You are well acquainted with the little Mackerel
Midge, first made known by myself, and which
has been denominated <i>Couchia glauca</i> by Thompson.
But previously to this, Colonel Montagu had published
an account of a species much like it, but differing
in having only two barbels on the snout. It
does not appear that any figure was given, but he
speaks of them as occurring in Devonshire, where he
lived. No one has seen a fish which answers to his
description since that time—I suppose more than
fifty years ago; and it has been judged that some
mistake was made, especially as he never gave a
notice of the Midge with four barbels. Yet Montagu
was a good Naturalist, and a correct observer.
He calls his fish Silvery Gade; for he wrote before
Cuvier made these fishes into a new genus, termed
Motella. But your fish answers closely to Montagu’s
lost fish. When I inform you that Montagu gives
the number of rays in the fins, you may judge how
closely he examined this fish. When my <i>History of
British Fishes</i> is ended, I intend to give a few as a
supplement, and as ascertained too late to fall into
the regular order. This little fish will find a place
there, when I shall take care to mention your name
as its rediscoverer.”</p>

<p>In a notice which Edward afterwards gave of the
fish he observed: “I may mention that this genus of
little fishes, designated with the appellation of <i>Midges</i>
from their small size, and containing three species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
are now authentically known to be inhabitants of the
Moray Firth, all three, both young and old of each,
having been procured here,—a circumstance which
perhaps can be said of no other single district but
our own. This, not so much for the lack of the fish
themselves, as from the want of <i>searchers</i> for these
things; for we cannot allow ourselves to think for a
single moment, that they could be found in so widely
distant localities as Cornwall, Belfast, Devon, and
here, and not be met with at intermediate places.
Such a thing appears to me to be one of those affairs
called <i>impossibilities</i>. Let those then who live on
the coast, and have time and a mind for these things,
or whether they have time or not, if they have the
Will,—let such, I say, look better about them, and
I doubt not but they will find many of these little
gems, as well as other rarities of a similar and kindred
nature.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MIDGES IN MORAY FIRTH.</i></div>

<p>Edward had not yet finished his discovery of
Midges in the Moray Firth. In November 1865 he
sent to Mr. Couch a specimen of a little fish which
he had caught, and which seemed quite new to him.
Mr. Couch replied that it was not only new to him,
but new to science. Mr. Couch expressed his regret
that the Midge “had come too late to find a place by
the side of its near relation, Montagu’s Midge, in his
work, the last number of which had just been published.”
He also added: “As your little fish is certainly
new, I have thought of sending an account of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
to the Linnean Society, in which case I should think
it only a piece of justice to affix your name to it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S MIDGE.</i></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">EDWARD’S MIDGE</span>—<i>Couchia Edwardii.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Couch accordingly prepared a paper for the
Linnean Society,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in which he embodied Edward’s
description of the fish, and of its habits and habitat.
He also attached to it the name of Edward’s Midge,
<i>Couchia Edwardii</i>. In the course of Mr. Couch’s
paper, he says:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COUCHIA EDWARDII.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Long before the discovery of the Mackerel Midge as
a separate species, an account had been given by Colonel
Montagu of a kindred fish, which he supposed to be common
to the coast of Devonshire, and which he described as being
distinguished by the possession of a pair only of the frontal
barbs; and yet for more than half a century this species
of Midge had remained in obscurity, until it was again
brought to light by the diligent and acute observation of Mr.
Thomas Edward of Banff, who found it in some abundance in
the Moray Firth, and kindly supplied the writer with examples,
which enabled him to give an account of it, with a
figure, in the concluding portion of the fourth volume of his
<i>History of the Fishes of the British Islands</i>. The five-bearded
species had been already represented in a coloured figure in
the third volume of the same book, as also in Mr. Yarrell’s
well-known volumes. But a vacancy still existed in the
analogy between the species of the nearly allied genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
<i>Motella</i> and <i>Couchia</i>; and it is this, again, we are able to
supply through the persevering diligence of Mr. Edward,
whose intelligence enabled him to detect the existence of
another species, and whose kindness has, with an example,
communicated materials which enable the writer to produce,
with a satisfactory likeness, a somewhat extended notice of
its actions, the latter of which will be described, as far as can
be, in this attentive observer’s own words. The length of
the example from which my notes were taken is an inch and
five-eighths; and as half a dozen others were about the same
size, it may be judged to be their usual magnitude, as it does
not differ much also from that of <i>C. glauca</i> and <i>C. Montagui</i>.
Compared with the latter, its shape is more slender, the
pectoral fin rather more lengthened and pointed, the ventral
fins longer and slender, the cilia on the back, along the edge
of the membrane, more extended, apparently more numerous,
and very fine; barb on the lower jaw long; but what especially
marks this little fish as distinct from the other species
is, that, besides the pair of barbs in front of the head, there
is a single one of much larger size in front of the upper lip,
and which points directly forward with a slight inclination
downward, thus analogically answering to the middle barb
that projects from the snout of the four-bearded Rockling
(<i>Motella cimbria</i>). It is probable that there are teeth in the
jaws, but they can scarcely be seen, and there is a row of
pores along each border of the superior maxillary bone.
Some further particulars of this fish I prefer to give in the
words of its discoverer, who describes its colour as a beautiful
deep green along the back when caught, the sides brilliantly
white; but when it reached me, preserved in spirit, it was
blue, with a tinge of the same along the lateral line. In some
examples in Mr. Edward’s possession the colour on the back
was a faint yellow, with a narrow stripe of bluish purple on
the side, and in all of them the silvery hue of the lower portions
of the body is found to rise nearer the back than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
other species of this genus. The back also and head were
thickly covered with very small, dark, star-like spots, which,
together with two narrow yellow streaks extending from the
top of the head, above the mouth, and diverging to the eyes,
had disappeared when subjected to my examination. Iris of
the eye silvery, the pupil bluish-green; the fins dull grey, as
also the pair of barbs; but the single one on the lip at its
root is almost of as deep a colour as the top of the head and
back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“I regard it as no other than an act of justice to the
discoverer of this fish to assign to it the name of Edward’s
Midge (<i>Couchia Edwardii</i>), of which the specific character is
sufficiently obvious.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Edward followed up this paper by a fuller
description of the Midge, after he had had an opportunity
of observing a much larger number of specimens.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OTHER NEW FISHES.</i></div>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to describe at length the
large number of new fishes belonging to the Moray
Firth which Edward for the first time recognised and
described. For instance, the Bonito, the Tunny—fishes
for the most part found in the Mediterranean,—the
Pilot-fish, the Bear-fish, the Short Sun-fish,
the Bald-fish, the Scald-fish, and several species of
Sharks. Strange fishes such as these had occasionally
been found before; but Edward never missed
the opportunity of carefully observing them and
describing their habits, sometimes in the <i>Zoologist</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and the <i>Naturalist</i>, and at other times in the
<i>Banffshire Journal</i>. He also endeavoured to secure
as many specimens as possible for the Banff Museum,
of which he was curator.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEST AUTHORITIES MISTAKEN.</i></div>

<p>When Edward informed Mr. Couch of the struggles
and difficulties he had to encounter in the
formation of a museum, the latter replied: “I can
sympathise with you, with a smile, at your annoyances
and disappointments as regards your attempts
at a museum; but a real love of nature, and even a
wish for anything beyond a very slight acquaintance
with it, are rare; and can scarcely be infused into
any one not naturally endued with so great a blessing.
With your museum there ought to be a collection
of books on Natural History.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
you say about the new Midge reminds me of what
occurred when I first announced the discovery of the
Mackerel Midge. A paper on it was read before the
Linnean Society, but they hesitated to publish it—thinking,
I believe, as in the present case—that the
fish was a young condition of some other known
species.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is much in the internal structure
of fishes that is not known generally, but which can
only be ascertained by dissection. In fact, the riches
of nature are inexhaustible; but if we cannot discover
all, there is no reason why we should not
continue our search after more of them. The most
unsatisfactory part of the subject is, to find how
greatly in some instances our best authorities are
mistaken.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LINNEAN SOCIETY.</i></div>

<p>The works of Mr. Couch and Mr. Spence Bate
being now published, and both of these gentlemen
having been so much indebted to the investigations
of Edward, it occurred to both of them to endeavour
to get him elected an Associate of the Linnean Society,
as a reward for his labours. Mr. Couch, in his letter
to Edward of the 1st November 1865, says: “There
is another thing which I think worthy of your notice;
for, as the world goes, honour is of some value; and
the honour I refer to is of intrinsic value, at the same
time that it will cost you nothing. In the Linnean
Society there is a company of Associates (A.L.S.)
limited to thirty; but at this time I think there are
no more than twenty-eight. These Associates are
entitled to several privileges in the society; and in
order to be elected, it is necessary to obtain the
recommendation of at least three of the Fellows,
which I suppose you can procure. I shall feel a
pleasure in signing the necessary application, and, if
applied to, I have no doubt Dr. Gray will do the
same.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bate warmly concurred in the proposal. The
application was drawn up, signed, and sent to the
Linnean Society. Dr. Gray was of opinion that a
similar application should have been made to the
Zoological Society for Edward’s admission as an Associate.
But this does not seem to have been done.
At length the day of the election arrived, and on the
5th of April 1866, Edward was unanimously elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
an Associate.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Mr. Couch wrote to congratulate him.
He said: “The number of Associates is now limited
to a few, so that it is very difficult to get elected,
but then it is a greater honour.”</p>

<p>It never rains but it pours. A few months later,
Edward was unanimously admitted a member of the
Aberdeen Natural History Society, at its monthly
meeting, held in Marischal College; and in March
1867, he was furnished with the diploma of the
Glasgow Natural History Society.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROPHET WITHOUT HONOUR.</i></div>

<p>“But a prophet is not without honour, save in his
own country.” Although Banff possessed an “Institution
for Science, Literature, and the Arts, and for
the encouragement of native genius and talent,” the
members did not even elect Edward an honorary
member. The Linnean Society—perhaps the most
distinguished Association of Naturalists in the world—had
discovered Edward’s genius and talent, and
elected him an Associate. But the scientific men of
Banff fought shy of the native shoemaker. It may,
however, be added, that the Banff Institution, finding
no native nor any other genius and talent to encourage,
became defunct in 1875, and handed over
their collection to the corporation, whose property
it now is.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small><i>ANTIQUITIES—KITCHEN-MIDDENS.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> had now been working for about ten years
along the sea-shore—collecting Crustacea, Molluscs,
Fish, and marine objects. He had won his honours,
and lost his health. His medical attendant had often
warned him to give up night work, and avoid exposure
of all kinds. But though Edward had given
up night work and partly recovered his health, he
would not give up the study of Nature.</p>

<p>He was now, however, compelled to abandon it
altogether.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The doctor was called in again, and
found him utterly prostrate. It was the old story—fever
and sore throat, the results of exposure, and
perhaps of insufficient sustenance. His illness was
more serious now than it had been before. In course
of time, however, he recovered. The doctor again had
a serious talk with him. He even threatened him
with a lunatic asylum if he did not altogether abandon
his out-door researches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p>When Edward was able to move about, he learned
to his unutterable grief the truth, which he would fain
have concealed from himself, that his career was
at an end as regarded his further researches into the
mysteries of nature. Though his mind remained as
vigorous as ever, his bodily constitution had been
seriously injured. He had lost the elasticity of
manhood, and never recovered it again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STUDIES GALVANISM.</i></div>

<p>Edward was so completely broken down, that he
was in a great measure disabled from working at
his trade. What, then, was he to do? His doctor
thought that it would be better for him to give up the
trade of shoemaking, and try something else. He
advised him to study electricity, with the view of
setting up a galvanic battery. He gave Edward books
for the purpose of studying the subject. But on considering
the matter, Edward came to the conclusion
that he did not know enough of the mechanism and
economy of the human system to apply the power
medicinally. Still the doctor urged him. Numerous
patients came to him to be galvanised, and he had not
time to attend to them himself; he would send all his
customers to Edward. But Edward had no desire to
be a quack, and to pour galvanism, of which he knew
little, into a body of which he knew less. At length
he came to the determination not to take up the
system of treating disease by electrical methods.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p>He was next advised to obtain some situation in
connection with Natural History,—such, for instance,
as the curator of a museum. He was already the
curator of the Banff Museum, but the remuneration
was almost nominal. In 1852, he had been appointed
curator at a salary of two guineas a year. After
about twelve years’ service, his salary was increased
to four guineas a year.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Even that was but a
nominal consideration. Edward naturally desired to
obtain some position with a salary sufficient to maintain
him. But he possessed no influence; he was
too shy to push himself forward; he had no one to
help him to obtain any situation; and he eventually
gave it up as a hopeless project.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRACTISES PHOTOGRAPHY.</i></div>

<p>His attention was next turned to photography.
He obtained a treatise on the subject; he read and
studied it; and then he purchased chemicals and
a camera. To obtain these, he again drew upon his
savings bank by selling another portion of his Natural
History collection. He found the practice of
photography very agreeable, and he was at length enabled
to take a very fair portrait. But he found that
really good portraits could not be taken except in
a glass-windowed apartment provided for the purpose.
He had no such apartment, and he had not money
enough to build one. His portraits were taken in the
open air. Perhaps, too, he wanted that deftness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
hand and delicacy of treatment which, had he been
younger, he would more readily have mastered. For,
by this time, Edward was growing old and stiff-handed.
Besides, there were other photographers in
the town, better provided with capital and machinery,
and it is scarcely to be wondered at if his trade in
photographic pictures should have been but small.
Yet some of his portraits, more particularly of himself
and his family, are exceedingly well done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANTIQUITIES OF BANFF.</i></div>

<p>In the meantime, however, the activity of his
mind and the closeness of his observation would not
allow him to remain at rest. He had done what he
could for science. But there were other things to be
thought over and written about. One of the subjects
that attracted him was Antiquities; and he began with
the Antiquities of Banff. Several articles on the
subject appeared in the <i>Banffshire Journal</i>, which
were thus introduced by the editor:—“We recently
mentioned that our townsman, Mr. Thomas Edward,
was engaged in preparing notes on the Antiquities
of the town and neighbourhood. We have pleasure
in giving the following extract from his MSS. The
extract, it will be seen, embodies two important practical
suggestions—one as to the obtaining and re-erecting
in the town the Old Cross of the Burgh; and the
other as to the erection of a Drinking Fountain.”</p>

<p>What Edward said about the ancient cross of
Banff and the proposed drinking fountain may best
be given in his own words:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CROSS OF BANFF.</i></div>

<p>“Banff, like every other town, had its ‘Cross.’
Where this ancient relic of ours had stood during the
various revolutions of the burgh, we are not aware.
We are told, however, that its last stance was on the
Low Street, nearly opposite the foot of the Strait
Path. From this we believe it was suffered to be removed
(to our praise as a community be it spoken)
to adorn the top of a dovecot about a mile from the
town, and on ground with which the public have
nothing to do. On inquiry, we learn that it is still
the property of the town. If this is correct, then we
say, Get it back. Yes, we say get back our venerable
and time-honoured Cross. No one can fail to observe
the almost universal restoration of the old works of
antiquity which is going on throughout the country.
Although nothing of this kind has yet taken place
here, our ancient Cross must be redeemed, and the
sooner it is done, the greater will be the credit due
to those who accomplish it.</p>

<p>“Our charitable bequests, as is well known, are
many and valuable. Still, we lack at least one—one
which would cost but little, and at the same time be
a universal good. There are many very wealthy individuals
in and belonging to the burgh, some of
whom may yet be persuaded to give us this desideratum.
We allude to a Drinking Fountain. These
things, too, be it remembered, are becoming universal,
although we have none of them. We maintain that it
would be a great and an inestimable boon to the place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN.</i></div>

<p>“But some may ask, What has this to do with
Antiquities? Well, perhaps not much yet, but we
trust it will soon have. We have said that a drinking
fountain would cost but little. Once erected, the
interest of a small sum annually would pay for the
water, and keep the place in repair. And besides
tending to be a blessing to thousands, it would be an
interesting and conspicuous ornament to the town,—and
one of the most refreshing which modern ingenuity
and gratitude could devise or rear. Supposing
that some of our philanthropic friends, who may
wish to have their names carried down to future
generations as being benefactors and lovers of their
species, might yet think well of our suggestion, and
give us a fountain,—could not our Cross be placed
upon it as a crowning stone? We think so. And
sure we are that no better emblem, nor one more expressive,
could be given to a place of the kind. But
although nothing of this kind may take place, still we
would urge the restoration of our old and venerable
Cross.”</p>

<p>The article produced no results. The suggestion
about the Cross trod upon the toes of some person of
local influence, and the idea of its restoration was
soon stamped out. The Drinking Fountain also remains
to be erected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KJÖKKEN-MÖDDING.</i></div>

<p>Edward was more successful in his investigations
of the Kjökken-mödding at Boyndie,—a much more
interesting piece of antiquity. Kitchen-middens, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
refuse heaps, have been discovered in large numbers
along the shores of the Danish islands. Not less
than a hundred and fifty have already been found in
Denmark. They consist chiefly of castaway shells,—of
the oyster, mussel, cockle, and periwinkle,—intermixed
with the bones of quadrupeds, birds, and
fish. Some of them also contain fragments of pottery
and burnt clay, and rude implements of stone and
bone, which have evidently been dropped by those
who took their meals in the vicinity of the heaps, or
who have thrown them away as useless.</p>

<p>These shell-mounds vary in height, in breadth,
and in length. They are from three to ten feet high,
and sometimes extend to a thousand feet in length,
while they vary from a hundred to two hundred
feet in width. It is evident, from these remains,
that some pre-historic people were accustomed to
live along the sea-shore, or to frequent it when food
failed them in the interior, and live upon molluscs
and fish. That they ventured out to sea in canoes
hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree (such as
are occasionally found in Danish peat-bogs) is obvious,
from the fact that the bony relics of deep-sea
fish, such as the cod, the herring, and the skate,
are occasionally found in the shell-heaps. No remains
of any agricultural produce, nor of domesticated
animals (excepting the dog), have been found in
them; so that it is probable that the people who
then occupied the land, were exclusively hunters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
fishers, and that they knew nothing of pastoral or
agricultural pursuits.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LAPPS OR FINNS.</i></div>

<p>Who these ancient people were, has been the subject
of much conjecture. It is not improbable that
they were Lapps or Esquimaux. The most ancient
skulls which have been found in Denmark, near the
shell-mounds, are small and round, indicating the
small stature of the people. Sir Charles Lyell says
that they bear a considerable resemblance to those of
the modern Laplanders. It is probable that a great
part of Europe was originally peopled by Lapps;
and that they were driven north by the incoming of
a more civilised race from the east. There are still
remnants of the Lapps in the island of Malmön, off
the coast of Sweden, in North Connaught and the
island of Aran in Ireland, in the island of Lewis off
the western coast of Scotland, and in several of the
Shetland Islands.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>When the discoveries in Denmark came to light,
and were republished in this country, investigations
began to be made as to the existence of similar shell-mounds
on the British coast. We do not know
whether the first investigations were made along the
shores of the Moray Firth; but they are the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
which we have any account. Numerous shell-heaps
had long been observed along the coast. They were
raised above the level of the highest tides; and the
impression which prevailed was, that they had been
collected there at some early period by an eddy of
the ocean. The shelly deposits were also adduced in
proof of a raised sea-margin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KITCHEN-MIDDEN AT BOYNDIE.</i></div>

<p>The Kitchen-midden at Boyndie, near Banff, had
long been known as a famous place for shells. Hence,
probably, its name of Shelly-bush. About forty years
since, Edward’s attention was drawn to it by a man
who had picked up shells from it when a boy. Edward
set it down in his mind as an old sea-margin, and
although often passing it in his journeys by the sea-side,
he never thought of it as anything else. When
Professor Macgillivray, of Aberdeen, was walking
with Edward along the Links, about the year 1850,
the latter pointed out to him the shell-bank. The
Professor remarked, that it did not look like any
other raised beach that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Years passed; but what with cart-wheels going
over it, and rude hands picking at it, the shells and
bones which it contained at length became more
clearly exposed. Still it was held to be but an ancient
sea-beach. Then came the news from Denmark
about the Kitchen-middens. A paper by Mr. (now
Sir John) Lubbock, appeared in the <i>Natural History
Review</i> for October 1861, which had the effect of
directing the attention of Archæologists to the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
“Macgillivray’s remark,” says Edward, “instantly
flashed upon me. I looked at the Shelly-bush
shells in our collection, and compared them
with the raised beaches of King Edward, and Gamrie.
I saw the difference in a moment, and smiled at my
own stupidity. Away I went to the Bush, and the
happy result was, that before I returned, I had the
inexpressible delight of ascertaining that the old sea-beach
was neither more nor less than a veritable
Kitchen-midden.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/image310.jpg" width="426" height="300" alt="castle and loch" />
<div class="caption">SPYNIE CASTLE AND LOCH.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LOCH OF SPYNIE.</i></div>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Gordon of Birnie, near Elgin, had
already found a similar accumulation of shells on the
old margin of the Loch of Spynie,—formerly an arm
of the sea. The mound is situated in a small wood
on the farm of Brigzes. It had been much diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
by its contents having been carted off from the
centre of the heap, as manure or top-dressing for the
adjoining fields. The mound—or rather couple of
mounds, for it has been cut into two parts—must
have been of considerable extent. It measured about
a hundred yards in length, by about thirty in breadth.
The most abundant shell found was the periwinkle,
or the edible “buckie,” as it is usually called. Next
in order was the oyster; and magnificent natives
they must have been. The bay of Spynie was then
a productive dredging-ground. On the extensive flat
around it, wherever a canal or ditch is dug up, the
shells of oysters are yet to be met with, seemingly
on the spots where they lived. Yet the oyster, as
well as the primitive people who fared on it, have
long since passed away.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONTENTS OF SHELL-MOUND.</i></div>

<p>The third shell in order, in this bank of shells, is
the mussel, and then the cockle,—all edible. “There
is evidence enough in these mounds,” says Dr. Gordon,
“to show that they have been the work of man,
and not the effect of any tidal current, or any other
natural cause. The shell-fish which the remains
represent are, with scarcely an exception, edible, and
continue to be eaten to this day. In all deposits by
the sea, there is abundance of species that have ever
been rejected as food. The shells are full-grown, or
adult shells. In collections made by the sea, the
young animals are abundant, and often predominate.
Now, no movements of wind and water could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
thus selected the edible and the adult, and left behind
the noxious and the young. They must have
been gathered by man, and for the purpose of supplying
his wants. Many other arguments have been
brought forward to prove this, so that no doubt is
now entertained about the matter. One strong proof
is, that the periwinkle and the oyster are never found
living and mingled together in the same part of the
sea. The former exists between tide-marks, the other
in deep water. The cockle delights in sand; the
mussel must be moored to a rock or hard bottom.
In different parts of the masses of shells at Brigzes,
there are to be seen many stones that have been subjected
to considerable heat. They probably have been
used in this state for cooking, as is known to be the
case among people of primitive habits to this day.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONTENTS OF BOYNDIE MOUND.</i></div>

<p>The shells found by Edward in the kitchen-midden
at Boyndie corresponded in a great measure with
those found by the Rev. Mr. Gordon at Brigzes.
Thus, he found the Periwinkle, the highly-esteemed
Buckie, the Limpet, the Horse Buckie (in some places
called the Dog Periwinkle), the Mussel; bones of various
kinds of wild animals, such as the Deer, the Hare,
and the Rabbit; the remains of several species of
fish, such as bones of the Skate; a few of the Crab
family; fragments of Pottery, and small bits of
charred wood and ashes. The ashes are just like
those left from a wood or peat fire. Small stones,
also, were got, partially blackened, as if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
been used for cooking purposes. One very common
ingredient among the fish was that part of the head
known as the “lug been,”—a bone usually given to
the children of the family to pick.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOYNDIE KITCHEN-MIDDEN.</i></div>

<p>“A remarkable fact,” says Edward, in his account
of the Boyndie kitchen-midden, “and one not mentioned
in any account of a similar place, is, that
whilst some of the shells crumble to dust almost with
the least touch, others are still so hard that they
would require the fingers of a giant to pound them.
The enamelling of some of the limpet and mussel
shells is still as beautiful as almost to persuade one
that the animal had been but newly taken out. On
the other hand, some are so far gone and so soft, as
to feel like a piece of wet blotsheet. But what appears
to be the most remarkable peculiarity in these
two very opposite extremes is, that the shells thus
spoken of may be found in the same handful and
from the same spot. Another very striking feature
is, that in handling the old ‘muck,’ one’s fingers
soon get nearly as black as ink. Here also, as in all
the other shell-accumulations, the larger bones are
broken—not cut, but broken up longitudinally, or
what might rather be called splintered. This has
been done, it is thought, to get at the fat or marrow,
of which these early people seem to have been very
fond. They broke the bone just as we break up with
some heavy instrument the large toes of a lobster
or parten in order to reach the food.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HUMAN BONES.</i></div>

<p>M. Engelhardt, in describing the Kiökkenmöddings
of Denmark, says that no human bones have
been found among the shell-heaps. Sir John Lubbock
has also said that “the absence of human remains
satisfactorily proves that the primitive population
of the North were free from the practice of
cannibalism.” Recent investigations have, however,
cast some doubts upon this statement. For instance,
Mr. Laing, M.P., read a paper before the Ethnological
Society on the 14th December 1864, in
which he described the results of his investigations
of the kitchen-middens at Keiss in Caithness, about
eight miles north of Wick. Large masses of periwinkle
and limpet shells, mixed with bones, flint
splinters, and bone instruments of the rudest sort,
were found. Among the bones, part of the jaw of a
child was discovered, which had been broken as if
to get at the marrow; and affording ground for presumption
that cannibalism was prevalent, or, at least,
was occasionally resorted to among the race to which
the remains refer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STONE PERIOD.</i></div>

<p>No human bones were found in the shell-heaps of
either Boyndie or Brigzes; so that Mr. Laing’s remarks
may, after all, prove to be a mere conjecture.
“One thing,” says Edward, “must be observed—that
no implements have as yet been found mixed up with
our shells; but whether this would indicate an earlier
or a later date, it would be premature even to hint.
Flint flakes, a portion of a flint knife, and a stone-axe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
or hatchet, have been found near some of the Morayshire
mounds, but not in them. They are, however,
considered to belong to the same period. In the
same way, the flint flakes, arrow-heads, elfshots,
found in the lower part of Banffshire, as also the two
curious rough-looking bits of stones formed like
knives, lately dug up near Banff, and now placed in
the Banff Museum, doubtless belong to the same bygone
days. Of this, however, we have a proof beyond
doubt, that those who had for a time sojourned at
Boyndie had, like the men of Denmark, gone out to
sea fishing. This we learn from the fact that
spines of large rays or skate, bones of other big fish,
such as the cod, ling, and haddocks, bits of old
sponge-eaten shells, as the scallop (Pecten maximus
and opercularis), the cow shell (Cyprina Islandica),
and the roaring buckie (Fusus antiquus), are found
in our shell-mound. Now these cannot be got except
in pretty deep water; and although no traces
of any of their vessels have as yet been met with
near the mound, still one, a <i>canoe</i>—very similar to
the ancient Danish canoe—was dug up some years
ago from a piece of marshy ground betwixt Portsoy
and Cullen.</p>

<p>“During a recent excavation of the mound in the
presence of a clerical friend, we came upon the two
following species of shells not previously noticed—the
flat-topped periwinkle (Littorina littoralis) and
the grey pyramid shell (Trochus cinerarius). These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
shells are both very common amongst the rocks at the
present day. As the list indicates, the periwinkle
was the most frequent shell in the mound; but we
went deeper down, and the farther we went into the
bank the limpet was most predominant, and in fact
was almost the exclusive shell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANTIQUITY OF SHELL-MOUNDS.</i></div>

<p>“Taking all these circumstances into account,
and weighing the matter carefully over, we cannot
come to any other conclusion than that the Kitchen-middens
must be of a very remote age. We know
nothing of the people who formed these mounds of
shells and bones. Tradition and history are altogether
silent. Archæology seems powerless to help
us, and ethnology’s vision fails to penetrate the
depths of obscurity. It would appear to be one of
those mysteries of the past which baffles even the
wisest.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN OLD BONE.</i></div>

<p>Edward collected further samples of articles taken
from kitchen-middens for the Museum, including a
series of shells—the oyster, the cockle, the periwinkle,
and the brown buckie or whelk—gathered from the
shell-heaps on the farm of Brigzes, near Elgin. He
had also several other fragments of antiquity collected
in the Museum, one of the most interesting
of which was the joint-bone of some extinct animal.
The story connected with this bone is rather curious.</p>

<p>Before Edward had any official connection with
the museum, he visited it one day in company with
his master; and there he first saw this particular bone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
He was struck by its size, thickness, and peculiar
shape. The idea flashed across his mind that
he had seen something like it in a picture; but he
could not remember where. Seeing his intent glance,
the curator asked him if he knew anything about it?
“Nothing,” said he, “except that it appears to me to
be a semi-fossilised bone of some of the pre-Adamite
monsters that are dug up now and then; but what
it is I cannot tell.” “It looks to me,” said the
curator, “to be nothing more than the root of a
tree: in fact I am sure it is. If it were a bone, as
you say, surely some of the gentlemen composing the
Scientific Society would know.” “Give it time,”
replied Edward, “and some one will yet be able to
tell us all about it.” “Time indeed!” said the curator,
“we have had it lying here far too long. I have
often thought of throwing it into the fire, and I will
do so when I have next the opportunity. It would
never have been here but for that old fool (naming a
previous curator), whose only aim seems to have been
to get the place filled up with useless trash.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the previous history of the bone
may be given. Some sixty years before, when a mill-dam
was being enlarged at Inverichny, in the parish
of Alvah, near Banff, one of the workmen came upon
a dark-looking object embedded in the bank amongst
clay and shingle, about six feet from the surface.
After being disengaged, it was found that the object
was very like a large hour-glass, though not tapering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
so much towards the middle. There were differences
of opinion amongst the workmen about the nature of
the thing. One said it was a “been,” another said
it was “an auld fir knot.” One man tried to break
it into pieces with a spade, but he failed. The hard
bone turned up the edge of the spade. It was
handed about, to ascertain if anybody could make
anything of it. At last it got into the hands of
Captain Reid of Inverichny. He showed it to the
three most important persons in his neighbourhood—the
minister, the doctor, and the dominie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONJECTURES ABOUT THE BONE.</i></div>

<p>The minister, though he could say nothing about
the bone, knew that there were great leviathans in the
waters, for he had read about them in the Scriptures;
but he had never seen any notice of such things
being found in clay banks. The doctor, after looking
at it, and turning it round and round, said that
if it was a bone, at least it did not belong to the
human structure. The dominie, like his other learned
friends, could throw no greater light upon the subject.
He did not think it was a bone at all, but only a
monstrous piece of petrified bamboo! Then the
men of science of the Banff Institution were applied
to, but they could make no more of the object than
the minister, the doctor, and the dominie. Finally
Captain Reid presented it to the museum of the
Banff Scientific Society; and there it remained until
Edward first saw it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE OLD BONE CONDEMNED.</i></div>

<p>It would appear, however, that the curator had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
become tired of the bone, or whatever else it was,
and wished to get rid of it. He removed it from
the case in which it was deposited, and threw it
among the rubbish of the museum. When Edward
was appointed sub-curator of the museum, about
nine years afterwards, his first natural impulse was
to go to the table where the bone had been deposited,
but lo! it had been removed. He searched the whole
place, but no bone was to be found. He feared lest
the curator had carried out his intention, and burnt it.</p>

<p>Next morning, Edward received orders to destroy
a lot of useless stuff which lay on the floor, consisting
of broken-down astronomical and philosophical instruments,
moth-eaten beasts, birds, and fishes, together
with other wrecked specimens of the long-neglected
museum. Edward went to work, and whilst groping
amongst the rubbish at the bottom of the heap, he
came upon a round dark object. He brought it up,
and lo! it was the “auld been”—in other words, the
old bone! It had not been burnt! He cleaned it
and put it in the old place.</p>

<p>When the curator next made his appearance to
ascertain how far the burning had gone, he gave a
glance at the case where the bone had been replaced.
He stood aghast. “You have put this thing on the
table again!” he shouted. “Yes,” replied Edward.
“Do you know,” rejoined the curator, “that by so
doing you are insulting myself, and the gentlemen
of the Society, who requested all objectionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
matter to be removed from the collection?” “I am
very sorry for that,” said Edward. “Then remove it
at once, and burn it with the rest.” Edward removed
it accordingly, but he did not burn it. He took it
home, and kept it there until he was able to replace
it in the museum.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;">

<div class="caption">THE “AULD BEEN.”</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE “AULD BEEN.”</i></div>

<p>When the curator next entered the apartment,
he glanced at the place where the bone had been, and
seeing that it had been removed, he said nothing
further about it. Shortly after, Edward was himself
appointed curator, and having the control of the
collection in his own hands, he restored the bone to
its former place. He was still most anxious to know
of what animal the bone had constituted a part. He
never failed to direct the attention of visitors to
the bone, and to inquire of them whether they could
give him any information about it. Thus time rolled
on, and despite of all his endeavours, the bone still
remained unknown and unnamed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.</i></div>

<p>At last Sir Roderick Murchison and Professor Ramsay
honoured the museum with a visit, in September
1859. Edward was sure that Sir Roderick would be
able to tell him all that he wanted to know respecting
the bone. It was the first thing that he put into Sir
Roderick’s hands. “Can you tell me what that is,
sir?” He took it up, turned it round and round, and
over and over, and remarked, “That is a most extraordinary
bone;” and then he asked when and where
it had been found. Edward told him all the facts
he knew respecting it, and added: “But can
you tell me to what animal it belonged?” “No,
I cannot tell,” replied Sir Roderick. Neither did
Professor Ramsay know anything about the bone.
“You see,” said Sir Roderick, “this does not lie in
my way. This is not exactly a geological specimen.
I am more a <i>stone</i> man than a <i>bone</i> man. Besides, it
is often a difficult matter to distinguish small fragments
or single bones of a skeleton, especially such a
remarkable one as this, and to determine with certainty
to what creature it belonged. But,” he added,
“if you have any stones in your collection unnamed,
or any particular rock in your neighbourhood that
you can show us, and which you and the stone men
of the district are in any doubt about, my colleague
and I will be most happy to sort them out for you.
As regards the bone, I’ll tell you what to do. Send
the bone to London, to Professor Owen. He’s your
man. He’s made up of bones. He’ll soon tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
all about it. And more, you can give him my compliments,
say you saw me, and that I told you to
send it.”</p>

<p>Edward did not, however, send the bone to London.
He knew from experience, that such things,
when sent so far away, rarely came back. That had
been the case with many of his Crustacea. He therefore
kept the bone at home, and continued his inquiries
of the <i>savans</i> who from time to time visited
the museum; but he never succeeded in obtaining
any favourable answer to his questionings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PLESIOSAURUS DOLICHODEIRAS.</i></div>

<p>Years sped on, and still the bone remained unknown.
At last, when Edward was rummaging over
some old books, he came upon the second volume of
the <i>Penny Magazine</i>. Whilst turning over the pages
by chance, he saw a picture of old bones which had
much puzzled his brains some thirty years before.
And now he remembered that it was the picture of
the bones here drawn, that had first given him the
idea that this bone in the museum was the remnant
of some extinct animal. And here was the creature
itself from which the bone had been taken. It was
the <i>Plesiosaurus dolichodeiras</i>; the bone in the
museum being one of the femurs of the fore-paddle
of that long extinct monster.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BANFF MUSEUM.</i></div>

<p>To make assurance doubly sure, Edward took a
photograph of the bone, and sent it to a scientific
correspondent in London; when he had the pleasure
of being informed there was no doubt whatever that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the bone was one of the femurs of the fore-paddle of
the Plesiosaurus. Here, then, was a discovery well
worth all the care, the trouble, and the anxiety which
the bone had occasioned. It may also be mentioned
that, so far as is known, no other fragment of the
Plesiosaurus has yet been found in Scotland. They
have been met with in England in the secondary
strata, and on the Continent, principally in the
Oolite and Lias. The bone in question is now one
of the most cherished relics of the Banff Museum.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small><i>CONCLUSION.</i></small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Edward’s</span> labours were now drawing to a close. He
had fought the fight of science inch by inch, until he
could fight no more. He had also fought the fight
of honest poverty—a great triumph and a great
glory.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The honest man, though e’er sae poor,</div>
<div class="verse">Is king o’ men, for a’ that.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is said that the man who can pay his way is
not poor. Edward could always do that. He was in
no man’s debt. He had lived within his means, small
though they were. Towards the end of his life, he
could only earn about eight shillings a week. But
his children were now growing up; and as he had
helped them in their youth, they now helped him in
his age.</p>

<p>He had become prematurely old. His constitution
had been seriously injured by his continuous
exposure to the night air. He had repeated illnesses—inflammations
of the throat and lungs, inflammations
of the stomach and bowels—each attack rendering
him weaker than before, until at last he
altogether gave up his researches, and confined himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to shoemaking,—occasionally attending as curator
at the museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CRAVING FOR NATURE.</i></div>

<p>Yet he never could get rid of his love of Nature.
He continued to admire the works of the Creator as
much as ever. On recovering from one of his illnesses,
he went to Huntly for a change of air. His wife
accompanied him. When she proposed doing so, he
asked the reason. “O!” she replied, “just to keep
ye company, and to help ye.” Accordingly she went
with him. While at Huntly, he felt his old craving
for Nature returning upon him. He wished to go
out and search the woods, the mosses, and the burns,
as before; but his wife never left him.</p>

<p>Whenever he indicated an intention of penetrating
a hedge or leaping a wall, she immediately interfered.
The hedge would tear his clothes, and she could not
accompany him in jumping dykes. He demurred,
and said, that if he went across, he would “come
back again.” But that did not suit her purpose, and
she would not let him go. As evening approached,
she said, “We’ll awa back noo.” He protested that
he would rather stay out. “No, no,” said she, “I’m
no gaun intill a hole like a wild beast; and, besides,
the nicht air would kill me.” In fact, as he afterwards
observed, “he had fallen into the hands of
the Philistines.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRAPS AT TARLAIR.</i></div>

<p>Edward still took pleasure in wandering along the
coast, and surveying the scenes of his former exploits.
One day he took a friend round to Tarlair, to look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the rock from which he had fallen. Standing on the
high ground above the shore, and looking down upon
the rock-pools beneath the promontory, he observed:
“I set many of my traps down there. I filled them
with seaweed, and sometimes with a piece of dead fish.
The sea came in and filled my traps, and sometimes
brought in many rare Crustacea. I set my traps
along the coast for about ten miles, from Portsoy to
Melrose Head. Many a time have I scrambled
amongst these rocks. But when I took ill, and the
inflammation went to my brain, I had to leave all
my traps, and there they are still.”</p>

<p>“What a fine chance that will be for some future
Ichthyologist,” said his friend; “he will find the traps
ready-made, and perhaps full of new species of crustaceans!”
“Weel,” said Edward, “it may be sae;
but I dinna think there’ll be sic a feel as me for
mony a lang year to come!”</p>

<p>Although he had long given up searching along
shore for new specimens of Fish, Crustaceans, or Molluscs,
yet he had still another discovery to announce.
There was a new fish remaining in his possession
which had been entirely lost sight of. He had taken
it in 1868, whilst searching amongst the rock-pools at
the Links. He kept it alive for two days, and when
it died he put it into a bottle, intending to send it to
Mr. Couch; but somehow or other the bottle got lost,
and, though he turned the house almost upside down,
he could never find it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NILSSON’S GOBY.</i></div>

<p>Only about a year ago, while turning over his
papers to find the letters referred to in the preceding
pages, he found the bottle containing the new fish at
the bottom of the box. How great was his delight!
But what was he to do with it? Mr. Couch was
dead, all his fish friends were dead, and he did not
know to whom to apply, to name the new fish. But
as he was about to proceed to Aberdeen to see Mr.
Reid, who was so kind as to offer to paint his portrait,
he took the fish with him. Mr. Reid procured an
introduction for him, through Dean of Guild Walker,
to Professor Nicol of Marischal College. The Professor
did not at first recognise the fish, but on referring
to his works on Ichthyology, he found that
it was a specimen of Nilsson’s Goby, a species not
before known to have been taken in British seas.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the thousands of specimens and
the hundreds of cases that Edward had been obliged
to part with during his successive illnesses,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he has
still sixty cases filled with about two thousand specimens
of natural objects. During his lifetime he has
made about five hundred cases with no other tools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
than his shoemaker’s knife and hammer, and a saw;
and he papered, painted, and glazed them all himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S DISCOVERIES.</i></div>

<p>As to the number of different species that he has
accumulated during thirty years of incessant toil, it
is of course impossible to form an estimate, as he
never kept a log-book; but some idea of his persevering
labours may be formed from the list of Banffshire
Fauna annexed to this volume.</p>

<p>Many of his discoveries have already become facts
in history, but a large proportion of them can never
be known. His specimens were sent to others to be
named, but many of them were never afterwards
heard of. This was particularly the case with his
shrimps, insects, zoophytes, corals, sponges, sea-slugs,
worms, tunicata or leathern-bag molluscs, fossils,
and plants. “Had any one,” he says, “taken pity
on me in time (as has sometimes been done with
others), and raised me from the dirt, I might have
been able to name my own specimens, and thereby
made my own discoveries known myself.”</p>

<p>Many of Edward’s friends told him that he should
have extended his inquiries into Aberdeenshire and the
northern counties; and that he should have explored
the coasts of the Moray Firth in all directions.
Others told him that he should have written and
published much more than he did, or was ever able
to do; and that he should have given many more
facts to the public. The only reply that he gave to
such advisers was, that he had neither the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
nor the means of doing so, having to work for his daily
bread all the time that he was carrying on his researches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT LAST ACCREDITED.</i></div>

<p>He had another difficulty to contend with, besides
his want of time and means. When he did publish
what he had observed with his own eyes, and
not in books through the eyes of others, his facts were
often disputed by the higher class of Naturalists.
He was under the impression that this arose from the
circumstance that they had never been heard of before,
and that they had now been brought to light by a poor
shoemaker—a person of no standing whatever. This
deterred him, in a great measure, from publishing his
observations, as he did not like his veracity to be
called in question. And it was not until years after,
when others higher up the ladder of respectability
had published the same facts, that his observations
were accredited,—simply because they could no
longer be denied.</p>

<p>Towards the close of his labours, Edward, on
looking back, was himself surprised that in the midst
of his difficulties—his want of learning, his want of
time, his want of books—he should have been able to
accomplish the little that he did. He had had so
many obstructions to encounter. His bringing up as
a child, and his want of school education, had been
very much against him. Then he had begun to work
for daily bread at six years old, and he had continued
to labour incessantly for the rest of his life. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
there was something much more than the mere manual
labourer in him. His mind had risen above his daily
occupation. For he had the soul of a true man.
Above all, he loved Nature and Nature’s works.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SELF-RELIANCE.</i></div>

<p>We need not speak of his stern self-reliance and
his indomitable perseverance. These were among the
prominent features of his character. Of his courage,
it is scarcely necessary to speak. When we think of
his nightly wanderings, his trackings of birds for days
together, his encounters with badgers and polecats,
his climbing of rocks, and his rolling down cliffs in
search of sea-birds, we cannot but think that he taxed
his courage a great deal too much.</p>

<p>A great point with him, was his sobriety. For
thirty-six years he never entered a public-house nor
a dram shop. He was not a teetotaller. Sobriety
was merely his habit. Some of his friends advised
him to take “a wee drap whisky” with him on cold
nights; but he never did. He himself believes that
had he drunk whisky, he never could have stood the
wet, the cold, and the privations to which he was
exposed during so many years of his life. When he
went out at night, his food consisted for the most part
of plain oatmeal cakes; and his drink was the water
from the nearest brook.</p>

<p>He never lost a moment of time. When his
work for the day was over, he went out to the links
or the fields with his supper of oatmeal cakes in his
hand; and after the night had passed, he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
home in time for his next day’s work. He stuffed
his birds, or prepared the cases for his collection, by
the light of the fire. He was never a moment idle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD’S FAMILY.</i></div>

<p>Another thing must be mentioned to his credit,—and
here his wife must share the honour. He brought
up his large family of eleven children respectably and
virtuously. He educated them much better than he
himself had been educated. They were all well clad
and well shod, notwithstanding the Scottish proverb
to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Both parents must have felt hope
and joy in the future lives of their children. This is
one of the greatest comforts of the poor,—to see their
family growing up in knowledge, virtue, industry,
well-being, and well-doing. We might say much of
Edward’s eldest daughter, who has not only helped to
keep her parents, but to maintain her brother at
school and college. It is families such as these, that
maintain the character and constitute the glory of
their country.</p>

<p>But to return to Edward and his culture. In one
of the earliest letters which the author addressed to
him, he made inquiry as to the manner in which he had
become acquainted with the scientific works which
are so necessary for the study of Natural History.
“You seem to wonder,” he said in his reply, “why I
did not mention <i>books</i> in my memoir. You may just
as well wonder how I can string a few sentences together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
or, indeed, how I can write at all. My books,
I can tell you, were about as few, as my education
was brief and homespun.</p>

<p>“I thought you knew—yes, I am sure you knew—that
any one having the Mind and the Will, need not
stick fast even in this world. True, he may not shine
so greatly as if he were better polished and better
educated; but he need not sink in the mire altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS POWER OF WILL.</i></div>

<p>“You may very likely wonder at what I have
been able to do—being only a poor souter,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>—with no
one to help me, and but few to encourage me in my
labours. Many others have wondered, like yourself.
The only answer I can give to such wonderers is, that
I had the <span class="smcap">will</span> to do the little that I have accomplished.</p>

<p>“If what I have done by myself, unaided and
alone and without the help of books, surpasses the
credulity of some, what might I not have accomplished
had I obtained the help from others which was so
often promised me! But that time is past, and there
is no use in saying anything more about it. If I suffered
privations, I had only myself and my love of
Nature to blame.”</p>

<p>He was sometimes told that it was his “pride”
which prevented him from being assisted as he should
have been. His answer was, that he did not know
anything about pride. But if it consisted in not soliciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
aid when in want, and in endeavouring to
conceal his poverty even when in need of help,—in
order that the world might not know of the misery
which himself, his wife, and his family suffered,—then
he did not hesitate to say that he and his wife were
proud. They never refused a kindly gift, but they
always refused public charity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEVER DESPAIR!</i></div>

<p>“Although,” he says in a recent letter, “I have
not known the pangs of want for some time, thanks
to my children, I could scarcely have failed to do so
in the years that are past. It would have been beyond
the common run of things, if I had not. What
working-man, especially what journeyman shoemaker,
could have brought up and educated a large family,
without at times feeling privation and the pressure of
poverty? There are other trades which have their dull
seasons; but, unlike most other tradesmen, shoemakers
are not, from their low pay, able to lay anything by,
even when they have plenty of work. And, as a
matter of course, this made the struggle, when it did
come, all the worse to bear.</p>

<p>“From these facts and others which I have told
you before, I say, and am ready to maintain against
every opposition, that no one who steps this earth, or
even crawls upon it, need ever despair, after what I
have done, of achieving whatever of good they have
once set their minds on. Firmness of purpose and
the Will to do and dare, will accomplish, I may say,
almost anything. The Will is the key that opens the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
door to every path, whether it be of Science or of
Nature, and every one has it in his power to choose
the road for himself.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONEY CONSIDERATIONS.</i></div>

<p>Notwithstanding Edward’s power of will and indomitable
perseverance, and the amount of useful
scientific work which he has accomplished, it was easy
to see that he was rather disappointed at the results
of his labours. It is true that his zoological labours
did not enable him to earn money: indeed, he
had not worked for money considerations. Natural
science is always unremunerative, especially to those
who have to work for their daily bread.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Nor had his
self-imposed labours lifted him above his position in
any way. He began life as a shoemaker, and he continued
a shoemaker to the end. Many called him a
fool because he gave himself up to “beasts.” He
himself says, “I have been a fool to Nature all my
life.”</p>

<p>“If it had not been for the industry of my children,”
he says, “my wife and myself would have been
in starvation these many years back, as all that I
have been making could scarcely have kept myself
in bread. So that is something. But if ever I complained
about my life, I never meant it to be in that
way. Had the object of my life been money instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
of Nature,—had I pursued the one with half the
ardour and perseverance that I did the other,—I have
no hesitation in saying that by this time I would
have been a rich man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THINGS HE HAS NOT DONE.</i></div>

<p>“But it is not the things I have done that vexes
me so much, as the things that I have <i>not</i> done. I
feel that I <i>could</i> have accomplished so much more.
I did not want the will, but I wanted the means. It
is that consideration that hurts me when I think
about it, as I sometimes do. I know what I have
done, and from that I can conceive how much more
I might have done had I got but a little help. Think
yourself—only think for a few moments—of a poor
illiterate working man struggling against every sort of
privation for so many years, with no other object in
view but simply to gain a little knowledge of the works
of creation,—think of that, and say if I can be blamed
because I occasionally grieve that I had no help,
when it would have enabled me to do so much more
than I have already done. For these reasons I sometimes
consider my life to have been a blasted one—like
a diamond taken from the mine, and, instead of
being polished, crushed to the earth in a thousand
fragments.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD AT HOME.</i></div>

<p>Still, Edward must, to a great extent, have enjoyed
a happy life. He was hopeful and cheerful.
He had always some object to pursue, with a purpose.
That constitutes one of the secrets of happiness. He
had an interesting hobby: that is another secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Natural History is one of the most delightful of
hobbies. He had the adventure, the chase, the capture,
and often the triumph of discovery. He must
have found great delight in finding a new bird, a new
star-fish, a new crustacean, a new ascidian. It must
also have been a pleasure to him to be in correspondence
with some of the most enlightened men of the
time; to have received their congratulations upon his
discoveries; and to have been rewarded with the
titular honours which they had to bestow.</p>

<p>But what did they think of him at home? A man
may be a well-disposed man out of doors, yet altogether
different in his domestic circle. Follow him
home, and see what he is there. We have seen that
Edward was a happy father and a happy husband.
His children, as we have said, were brought up well
and virtuously. There was no better conducted family
in Banff. When young they assisted him in his
labours amongst his fishes and crustaceans; and,
when old, they were proud to help him in all ways.
Is not this a great feature in a man’s character?</p>

<p>What did his wife say of him? When reminded
of his wanderings about at night, and asked what
she thought of them, she replied, “Weel, he took
such an interest in beasts, that I didna compleen.
Shoemakers were then a very drucken set, but his
beasts keepit him frae them. My man’s been a sober
man all his life; and he never negleckit his wark. Sae
I let him be.” Wise woman!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Scotch people are very reticent. They rarely
speak of love or affection. It is all “understood.” It
is said that a Scotchman will never tell his wife that
he loves her, until he is dying. But you can always
tell, from the inside of a house, what the woman is,
and how her husband regards her. In these respects,
it may be said, that Edward, though poor and scrimp
of means, has always enjoyed a happy home; and
that is saying a great deal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS OUTSIDE HELPERS.</i></div>

<p>It is not, however, the amount of love and respect
with which a man is regarded at home, that satisfies
him,—so much as the esteem with which he is
regarded by his fellow-men. When a man works
gratuitously for science, and labours for the advancement
of knowledge, he seems entitled to admiration
and respect. But Edward did not think that his
labours had been properly recognised. This seems
to have vexed him very much. He had often
been promised aid in the shape of books. But
no such aid ever came. “All my honours,” said he,
“have come from a distance. I have kept the
museum of the Banff Institution for about twenty-one
years, for I may say almost nothing; and though the
Linnean Society thought me worthy of being elected
an Associate, the people here did not think me worthy
of being an honorary member of their Society. Still,
I am not complaining. The people of Banff had no
right to make me a gentleman.”</p>

<p>The truth is, that it was a misfortune for Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
to have lived so far from the centre of scientific
pursuits. Banff was a place comparatively unknown.
In the pursuit of science, a man requires fellowship.
He especially requires the fellowship of books. Banff
could do little for him in this respect. Had he lived
in a larger town, with a library at his command, he
could have acquired the friendship of scientific men,
who are rarely disposed to be narrow in their “encouragement
of native genius and talent,” however
poor the student may be.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS FAILURES.</i></div>

<p>But it was difficult for Edward to remove to any
other place. He had his family to provide for, and
he had not the means of removing them elsewhere.
He was tied like a limpet to its rock. Still, he did all
that he could to improve his position where he was.
He tried to secure an appointment in connection with
the police; but having no influence, he failed. He
applied to the London College of Surgeons for a
curatorship, but Mr. Quekett having informed him
that it was only a fourth portership that was wanted,
he failed there too. Then he studied electricity, for
the purpose of assisting a doctor in electrifying his
patients; but thinking that he might kill more than
he could cure, he gave up the idea of proceeding
further. He next tried photography, but not being
provided with sufficient capital, he gave up that too.
The last application he made was for an appointment
as sub-curator of the City Industrial Museum of
Glasgow, but he received no encouragement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RESIGNATION.</i></div>

<p>After abandoning photography as a means of subsistence,
he returned to his old trade. “As a last
and only remaining source,” he said in June 1875,
“I betook myself to my old and time-honoured friend,
a friend of fifty years’ standing, who has never yet
forsaken me, nor refused help to my body when weary,
nor rest to my limbs when tired—my well-worn
cobbler’s stool. <span class="smcap">And here I am still</span> on the old
boards, doing what little I can, with the aid of my
well-worn kit, to maintain myself and my family;
with the certainty that instead of my getting the
better of the lapstone and leather, they will very soon
get the better of me. And although I am now like
a beast tethered to his pasturage, with a portion of
my faculties somewhat impaired, I can still appreciate
and admire as much as ever the beauties and wonders
of Nature, as exhibited in the incomparable works of
our adorable Creator.”</p>

<h2>SELECTIONS FROM
THE FAUNA OF BANFFSHIRE,</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> THOMAS EDWARD, A.L.S.</p>


<h3>MAMMALS.</h3>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Meles taxus</span> [<i>Badger or Brock</i>]. See <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>.</div>

<div class="hang2">Sparingly met with in our wooded districts.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mustela martes</span> [<i>Pine Marten</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Found chiefly in the higher parts of the county. One was observed,
in 1848, to descend from a tree in the hills of Boyndie,
and go into a rabbit’s hole. The hole was stopped up, and a
spade was brought to dig the animal out. It had, however,
escaped by another outlet from the burrow.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mustela putorius</span> [<i>Polecat or Fumart</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">See <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mustela vulgaris</span> [<i>Weasel or Whitret</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">More frequent than the polecat. Whilst the latter would seem
to delight more in plantations and whins, the other would appear
to think more of old dykes, grassy hillocks, and small
cairns of stones. Both are very destructive, killing much more
than they devour. See <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mustela erminea</span> [<i>Ermine or Stoat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species is often mistaken for the weasel. They are very
similar during summer, their colours being then the same. In
winter, however, the ermine changes to a pure white, excepting
in a portion of the tail, which is always black. In this state
they are all but universally called “<i>White</i>,” or rather “<i>Fite
Futrates</i>.” The true weasel never changes.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lutra vulgaris</span> [<i>Otter</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Often met with in suitable localities along the sea-shore, as well
as by many of our streams and streamlets. See <a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Canis vulpes</span> [<i>Fox, Tod Lowric, or Reynard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A well-known animal, especially in the country districts. See
<a href="#Page_109">pp. 109</a>, <a href="#Page_219">219</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Felis catis</span> [<i>Common Wild Cat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The wild cat is now, perhaps, extinct with us, though at one
time it was frequently found in the woods and rocky glens
of the more alpine portions of the interior. One which I had
the pleasure of seeing, and which was killed in Glen Avon,
measured over four feet in length, and was well proportioned in
every other respect. It was altogether a very formidable
looking animal.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Talpa Europæa</span> [<i>Mole or Mowdiewort</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This harmless creature is often met with. It is very useful to
agriculturists by turning up the fertile soil, yet they constantly
wage war against it. Pure white varieties are sometimes met
with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Erinaceus Europæus</span> [<i>Hedgehog</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Even since I remember, “hedgey” was altogether unknown, or
at least very seldom seen, in Banffshire. Now he is plentiful,
and seems to be still on the increase. See <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1">
<span class="smcap">Vespertilio pipistrellus</span>} [<i>Bat or Backie</i>].<br />
<span class="smcap">Vespertilio Daubentonii</span> }<br />
</div>

<div class="hang2">These are both to be found here. The first is the most common.
It appears that we have another species of bat here. It is
larger than either of the other two. I have met with it
in our woods.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sciurus vulgaris</span> [<i>Squirrel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It is only of late that this agile and tricky little quadruped has
become domiciled in this county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Myoxus avellanarius</span> [<i>Dormouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am not quite sure whether we have this animal or not; I think
I have taken it, but am not able to ascertain the fact with
certainty.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mus musculus</span> [<i>Common Mouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">There is no doubt about this sly little domestic. Specimens of
various colours—such as white, gray stripped with white,
reddish, and yellow—sometimes occur. Musical individuals of
the genus are not infrequent. See <a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mus sylvaticus</span> [<i>Long-tailed or Wood Mouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Is to be found in almost every conceivable situation, except in
towns.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mus messorius</span> [<i>Harvest Mouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This sleek little thing, the smallest of British quadrupeds, is now
well ascertained to be a native of Banffshire. I have myself
taken it several times.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mus rattus</span> [<i>Black Rat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This, the native British rat, though at one time very abundant,
is so no longer. It has been expelled or driven back, as the
Celts have been by the Scandinavians, by the Norway rat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
black rat is seldom seen now. Pure white varieties have been
found.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mus decumanus</span> [<i>Norwegian Rat or Rottin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very plentiful, and bids fair, erelong, to extirpate his weaker
relative, the Black Rat. See <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Arvicola amphibia</span> [<i>Water Rat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">To be found on the banks of all our streams. It is sometimes
turned up with the plough, at a considerable distance from the
water. It is a curious circumstance that the water rats of
England are mostly of a light brown colour, whilst those of
Scotland are usually jet black.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Arvicola agrestis</span> [<i>Short-tailed Field Mouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful, and very destructive to young trees.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Arvicola pratensis</span> [<i>Meadow Mouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like the last in appearance and habits. It is recognisable by its
much longer tail.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sorex araneus</span> [<i>Common Shrew</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sorex fodiens</span> [<i>Water Shrew</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Found along burnsides, and occasionally in ditches.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sorex remifer</span> [<i>Black Water Shrew</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Not so frequently found as the last. The water shrew is very
difficult to be taken. I never could manage to trap any of
them. They baffled all my ingenuity. My only resource was
the gun, and even with it I have often had enough to do. I
have sat for from six to seven hours without moving, watching
for an opportunity of shooting the water shrew, and been
doomed to disappointment at last.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lepus timidus</span> [<i>Common Hare or Maukins</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very plentiful in the low grounds. See <a href="#Page_106">pp. 106</a>, <a href="#Page_274">274</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lepus variabilis</span> [<i>Blue or Alpine Hare</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species is only to be met with in the hills and mountains,
except when driven down by stress of weather. In very severe
winters they occasionally descend in great numbers to the
lower part of the county, at which time they are of a pure
white.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lepus cuniculus</span> [<i>Rabbit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very plentiful, in every conceivable spot, from the rocky shore,
the sandbank, the quarry hole, the stony cairn, the old dyke,
the garden, the orchard, and the open field, to the thickest
woods. White, black, cream coloured, stripped, and pied
varieties, occur. See <a href="#Page_106">pp. 106</a>, <a href="#Page_275">275</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cervus elaphus</span> [<i>Stag, Red or Highland Deer</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This, perhaps the fleetest, as he is the noblest of our wild animals,
still holds his place in the county, though not now so
numerous as he used to be.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cervus capreolus</span> [<i>Roe Deer</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The roe seems to be more widely distributed than the red
deer; and whilst the latter usually inhabits the more
sequestered heath, grassy dells, and wooded glens of the
higher lands, the other is mostly found in the plantations and
copses of the lower levels. See <a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Phoca vitulina</span> [<i>Seal or Selch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Stray individuals of this aquatic tribe pay us a visit now and then.
They are common in Cromarty Firth.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Delphinus phocæna</span> [<i>Porpoise or Sea Hog</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another watery visitant, much more frequently seen than
the seal.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Delphinus delphis</span> [<i>Striped Porpoise or Dolphin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A specimen of this beautiful porpoise was taken here in 1853.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Delphinus tursio</span> [<i>Bottle-nosed Porpoise</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species is said to have been taken here, though there are
some doubts as to the fact.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Delphinus deductor</span> [<i>Pilot Whale</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several of these have from time to time been met with. There
are other species of whales which have been captured here.
One, reported to have been a monster for size, is said to have
been found amongst the rocks, so far back as about the beginning
of last century, betwixt the Boyne and the point known
as the King’s Head, but of what species is not accurately
known. It is stated in the “Statistical Account of the Parish
of Rathven,” which extends about ten miles along the coast
west of Cullen, that the porpoise, the grampus, and the spermaceti
whale, are frequently seen along the shore.</div>


<h3>BIRDS.</h3>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Aquila chrysaetos</span> [<i>The Golden Eagle</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The eagle breeds in the highest parts of the county, in the rocky
heights near Ben Avon (see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>). They have also been seen
hovering about the sea-braes between Banff and Portsoy.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Aquila albicilla</span> [<i>The Erne or Sea-Eagle</i>] has also been found.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Aquila haliaetus</span> [<i>The Osprey, Fish Hawk, or Fishing Eagle</i>] has
also been found. A very fine male specimen was shot amongst
the high cliffs of Gamrie Head. Another was seen at Melrose,
a few miles from where the other was obtained.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco peregrinus</span> [<i>The Peregrine Falcon, Blue or Hunting Hawk</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The Peregrine is one of our native hawks, and breeds annually,
though very sparingly, and usually in inaccessible places in
some of our highest headlands. Peregrine falcons have been
taken from their nests in Troup Head. As to the manner in
which they devour their prey, see <a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco æsalon</span> [<i>The Merlin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A daring little fellow that breeds on several of our hills, more
particularly on the Knock, the Bin (Huntly), Auchindoon, and
Benvennis. When strolling along our sea-braes early one
morning, I heard a tremendous noise of rooks and jackdaws
ahead of me, and on coming to the spot I found them attacking
a little merlin. One would have thought that such a host
would have smothered the little creature in a twinkling. But
such was not the case. The crows did not assail him all at
once, nor yet singly; but three, four, and as many as seven,
would be on him at a time, the main body keeping at a short
distance, encouraging their companions, as it were, with their
cawings. After a while, one of these storming parties would
retire, and then another would sally forth to the charge. The
merlin, however, being of lighter mettle and swifter of wing,
managed, with wonderful dexterity, generally to avoid their
attacks; now rising, now descending, and now turning in a
zigzag direction, first to one side, then to the other; and
succeeding, whilst doing so, in giving one or other of his
adversaries a pretty severe peck, which had the effect of sending
him screaming away. At last, however, a crow, which
seemed more courageous than the rest, rushed at the merlin
with such fury that I actually thought he would have swallowed
him up at once, or sent him headlong into the sea. But
no! the merlin withstood the shock, and contrived to deal his
assailant a thrust as he approached and passed him. The
merlin now rose considerably higher, and was followed only by
this single opponent, who returned with redoubled fury to
the combat. Up, up they soar, fighting as they go. They
close, they scream, they grapple, and their feathers fly like dust.
Down they come, locked in deadly embrace. I run to catch
them both. But no! See! they part, mount again and
again, scream, close, and, as before, fall, but not this time to
the earth; they part and mount again. But ’tis now their
last time; for the hawk, rising several yards above his bold
and venturous antagonist, rushes down upon him with a yell,
such as hawks alone, when irritated, know how to utter, and
with such force that both fell right down into the sea, above
which they were then fighting. I looked to see them rise
again; but they did not. After a little splashing, all was over
with the crow, but not with the hawk: he was still alive,
although in a very precarious situation, from which he made
several unsuccessful attempts to rise, but could not. It would
seem that in dealing the death-blow to his tormentor he somehow
or other got himself entangled, perhaps by his talons
entering some of the bones of the crow, from whence he could
not extract them. Both met with a watery grave, for on my
leaving the place, they were both fast drifting seaward, a breeze
blowing off the land at the time, with the crows hovering over
them and still cawing.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco nisus</span> [<i>The Sparrow-Hawk</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another daring individual. When standing on our Links
not long since, and speaking to one of our keepers, something
struck me on the breast and fell to the ground. Instantly, and
like a flash of lightning, down rushed a sparrow-hawk, and
picked up a thrush from betwixt us; it rose with its booty,
and was out of sight before we could raise our guns to fire at it.
The keeper grumbled a great deal at our seeming stupidity.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco tinnunculus</span> [<i>The Kestrel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This mouse-, insect-, and caterpillar-eating bird, or hawk if you
will, is very common with us. When a boy I kept, amongst a
host of others, several of this species. I remember that when
a mouse, a young rabbit, a leveret, and a middle-sized rat, were
presented at the same time, either of the former was sure to
be pounced upon, whilst the latter usually lay unheeded. Since
then, during my thirty years of taxidermal practice, I have
often dissected this bird, and found in its stomach the remains
principally of the smaller quadrupeds, insects (chiefly beetles),
and caterpillars. Yet this poor bird is persecuted with as
much severity as birds of the most destructive kind.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco palumbarius</span> [<i>The Goshawk</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One was shot at Tomintoul a short time ago, and two others—one
at Hillton, the other at Macduff. It is rather a rare bird.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco milvus</span> [<i>The Kite</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird was once plentiful here, but it is now rarely seen. A
splendid specimen was recently shot at Eden, about four miles
from Banff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco buteo</span> [<i>The Buzzard</i>]. Occasionally met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco lagopus</span> [<i>The Rough-Legged Buzzard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">More frequent than the last. One in my collection was killed on
the hill of Dunn, and another in the museum was shot at Forglen.
The nests of this species have also been found in the
neighbourhood, though rarely.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco apivorus</span> [<i>The Honey Buzzard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A still rarer species. A splendid specimen was shot at Gamrie a
few years ago. They are usually termed “Gleds” with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco æruginosus</span> [<i>The Marsh Harrier</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Specimens of these birds are occasionally shot in this neighbourhood.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco cyaneus</span> [<i>The Hen Harrier</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Occasionally met with. The male is known here by the names of
gray, blue, and lead hawk; the female by the name of ring-tail.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Falco cinerascens</span> [<i>Ash-coloured Harrier</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only met with one of this species here. It was a first-rate
specimen,—a male, and a very pretty bird.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix otus</span> [<i>The Long-eared Horned Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful. I once found a nest of this bird with eggs about the
middle of March. See <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix brachyotus</span> [<i>The Short-eared Owl, Woodcock, or Grass Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A migrating species with us. Specimens are frequently met with
by sportsmen when out shooting snipes, woodcocks, etc.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix flammea</span> [<i>The Barn Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird, though common in England, is very rare with us. I
know of only four being procured within twenty-four years.
One is in my own collection.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix aluco</span> [<i>The Tawny or Brown Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Almost equal in numbers to the long-eared owl, which is plentiful.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix nyctea</span> [<i>The Snowy Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One of the most magnificent of the owl tribe. What a splendid
and showy bird! I think the term “glistening” or “spangled”
might, with all truth and justice, be applied to this shining
species. What a noble-looking bird! What beautiful eyes!
the pupil dark, and the iris like two rings of the finest burnished
gold, set, as it were, in a casket of polished silver. I am glad,
nay proud, of being able to give this king of British owls a
place in my list, and of being able, perhaps for the first time,
to say that at least one pair have been known to breed within
the district. A few miles west of Portsoy, and not far from
Cullen, stands the bold and towering form of Loggie Head. In
connection with this rocky promontory, and about midway
up its rugged height, there is a narrow cave or chasm called
“Dickie Hare.” In this cave a pair of these owls bred in 1845.
Unluckily, however, for them, a party of fishermen belonging
to Cullen, returning one morning from their vocation
discovered their retreat, by observing one of the birds go in.
This was too good to lose sight of, so up the dangerous and
jagged precipice scrambled one of the crew, and managed to
reach the aperture where the bird disappeared; but instead of
only one, as he expected, he was not a little surprised to find
that he had four to deal with, two old and two young ones well
fledged; and the apartment was so narrow that only one person
could enter at a time, so that help was out of the question;
and his ambition grasped the whole. What was he to do, or
what could he do? Turn?—then the birds would have flown.
No! but, just as I would have done had I been in his place,
he set upon them all; and, after a prolonged and pretty severe
battle, in which he got himself a good deal lacerated and his
clothes torn by the claws of the birds, he succeeded in capturing
them all alive, except one of the young ones, which fell a
sacrifice to the struggle. The state of excitement which the
little town was in as the man landed with his prizes, and the
news of his morning’s achievement spread, may in some
measure be imagined, but can hardly be described.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strix passerina</span> [<i>The Little Owl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I give this bird a place on the authority of a Mr. Wilson, who
informs me he saw one in a wood near this place.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Muscicapa grisola</span> [<i>The Spotted Fly-Catcher</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It is somewhat strange, but not less strange than true, that this
sylvan and garden-loving species should also be found nestling
and inhabiting our wild and rocky ravines; yet such is the case.
I have met with them twice.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Muscicapa atricapilla</span> [<i>The Pied Fly-Catcher</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have a specimen of this bird, a male, in my possession, which
was shot about thirteen miles from this place.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cinclus aquaticus</span> [<i>The Dipper, or Water-Cockie</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Every means has been put in requisition to destroy this little bird.
It was abundant thirty years ago; but it is now rarely to be seen.
It was supposed to destroy the young salmon, hence it has been
shot down wherever found. But I have never as yet found
anything appertaining to fish in its stomach, and I have dissected
about forty,—water insects and their larvæ being what I have
most frequently observed.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus viscivorus</span> [<i>The Missel Thrush</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">About twenty years ago such a bird was scarcely known among
us, but now it bids fair to outnumber the common species; for
as the one gains ground, the other seems to lose it.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus pilaris</span> [<i>The Fieldfare</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter visitor. We call them “Hielan’-pyats,” that is “Highland
piets.” They arrive in October, and depart in April. Some
seasons they occur in thousands, but in others only sparingly.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus musicus</span> [<i>The Song Thrush or Mavis</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Usually very common in this neighbourhood, but becoming superseded
by the missel thrush. (For its singing propensities see
<a href="#Page_269">p. 269</a>.) There is one fact in connection with the rearing of
these birds which I must not omit to mention,—namely, that if
any of the young refuse to open their mouths to receive food
when offered, the old one knocks them soundly on the head
with his bill until they did so. I have observed this frequently,
and was not a little amused at it.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus iliacus</span> [<i>The Redwing</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter visitor, like the fieldfare, but not nearly so numerous.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus merula</span> [<i>The Blackbird, Blackie</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Generally distributed, but not in great plenty in any place. White
varieties have occasionally been met with, as well as pied.
When the winter storms send the thrushes to the sea-shore
to seek for food, this bird betakes himself to farm-steadings and
stable-yards, so that he never suffers so much as the thrushes do.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Turdus torquatus</span> [<i>The Ring Ouzel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. A few breed now and then among the higher districts of
the county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Accentor modularis</span> [<i>The Hedge Sparrow</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Generally distributed, but nowhere in abundance.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia rubecula</span> [<i>Robin Redbreast</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This rather bold, red-breasted gentleman, or cock-robin as we call
him here, is somewhat more numerous than the last.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia phœnicurus</span> [<i>The Redstart</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequents our gardens, and breeds there.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia tithys</span> [<i>The Black Redstart</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am only aware of two of these birds having been seen in our county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia rubicola</span> [<i>The Stonechat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia rubetra</span> [<i>The Whinchat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Neither of these birds are very numerous with us; but they may
occasionally be seen in suitable localities,—the first is with us
all the year, and the other, though migratory, is occasionally
seen in winter.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia œnanthe</span>[<i>The Wheatear</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A summer visitor. Wheatears generally appear on the sea-coast
first, from whence they disperse inland. They are called with us
the “Stone Chatterer.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia phragmitis</span> [<i>The Sedge Warbler</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Comparatively rare. It is only of late years that this bird has
visited us. How pleasant and enchanting it is to wander by
the margin of the running stream either at latest even, or at
earliest morn, or even during summer’s midnight hours, and
hear the sedge warbler pouring forth his long harmonious song,—himself
all the while hid in some neighbouring bush. See
<a href="#Page_51">pp. 51</a>, <a href="#Page_125">125</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia atricapilla</span> [<i>The Blackcap</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rarer even than the last. A most noble songster, though I
prefer the thrush.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia cinerea</span> [<i>The Whitethroat</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">More numerous than either of the two last. It arrives about the
same time.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia sibilatrix</span> [<i>The Wood Wren</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very rare. It is only seen at intervals, though it is supposed to
breed here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia trochilus</span> [<i>The Willow Wren</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Common throughout the whole county. It is found in plantations,
whins, brooms, and in gardens and orchards. It generally
nests on the ground. It is a very lively songster.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sylvia rufa</span> [<i>The Chiffchaff</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The only bird of this kind that I have seen, is one that I took
myself in the Duff House policies.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Regulus cristatus</span> [<i>The Golden-crested Regulus or Wren</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Wherever there are suitable woods, this bird is to be found among
us in pretty fair numbers.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus major</span> [<i>The Great Titmouse</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus cæruleus</span> [<i>The Blue Titmouse</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus ater</span> [<i>The Cole Titmouse</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus caudatus</span> [<i>The Long-tailed Titmouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These birds all exist in the county in about equal numbers. It
is rather an interesting and pleasant sight, and one which I
have often witnessed, to see small bands of these lively, active
little birds, together with the goldcrests and creepers, all in
company, foraging about amongst the leafy trees in winter;
the tits on the branches, the creepers on the trunk, and, if there
is no snow on the ground, the goldcrests generally lower down,
near about the roots. All is life, bustle, and animation, each
cheering the other with its tiny note. See <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus palustris</span> [<i>The Marsh Titmouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird is very seldom seen among us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Parus cristatus</span> [<i>The Crested Titmouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This rare British Tit is an inhabitant of the higher and middle
districts of the county, where it breeds occasionally.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Bombycilla garrula</span> [<i>The Waxwing</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird is an occasional winter visitor. Some seasons large
flocks appear, then only a few; then, again, perhaps none;
and this may be the case for many succeeding seasons.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Motacilla yarrelli</span> [<i>Pied Wagtail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Wherever there is a stream or a quarry, you will meet, in summer,
with a pair or two of these active little insect-eaters.
During winter, they are invariably to be seen on lawns, or
about mills and farm-steadings. They remain with us all the
year round.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Motacilla boarula</span> [<i>The Gray Wagtail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is our yellow wagtail, being known by no other name.
Though generally distributed throughout the country, it is not
nearly so abundant. It sometimes breeds in company with the
sand martin.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Motacilla campestris</span> [<i>Ray’s Wagtail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Only an occasional visitor with us. They breed plentifully
amongst the hillocks which stretch along the line of coast
between the Don (Aberdeenshire) and Newburgh,—then again
from Peterhead to Fraserburgh.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anthus arboreus</span> [<i>The Tree Pipit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird is frequently seen; it breeds near Inverkeithnay,
Rothiemay, and Inveraven.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anthus pratensis</span> [<i>The Meadow Pipit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful throughout the whole county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anthus obscurus</span> [<i>The Rock Pipit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Known all along our coast.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anthus ricardi</span> [<i>Richard’s Pipit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only seen this bird once, at the foot of the Knock Hill.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alauda arvensis</span> [<i>The Skylark or Laverock</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Universally distributed along the whole length and breadth of the
county. It is, I think, the most numerous bird we have.
Towards the months of October and November a great diminution
of its numbers takes place. But a little after New Year’s
Day they again begin to make their appearance. Where they
have been in the meantime, I have never been able to ascertain;
one thing is certain, however, that I have seen them returning
from the east and from the north, in immense numbers.
(See <a href="#Page_127">pp. 127</a>, <a href="#Page_269">269</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alauda arborea</span> [<i>The Wood Lark</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have seen but one of these birds, in the avenue of Duff House.
It was alone and in song at the time—May 27, 1850.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Emberiza nivalis</span> [<i>The Snow Bunting</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Seen in large flocks during winter, and exhibiting a motley mixture
of pure white, jet black, dull tawny, and deep chestnut,—a
beautiful band across the wings being conspicuous only in
flight. They arrive about the beginning of November, and
depart about the first of April. They sing beautifully, in a
sweet low lilt.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Emberiza miliaria</span> [<i>The Corn Bunting</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird is not very numerous with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Emberiza schœniclus</span> [<i>The Black-headed Bunting or Ring Fowl</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It frequents the mosses. I have found their nests in bushes,
amongst reeds, or on the ground. It is called the “Moss
Sparrow” by the country people. I once saw a black variety
of this bird, and another almost yellow.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Emberiza citrinella</span> [<i>The Yellowhammer</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">More numerous than either of the two last. The common name
here is “Skite.” It is not particular as to the place where it
builds its nest. I have seen one built in a rut on a cart-track,
close by the wayside. On passing afterwards, I found the
nest had been destroyed by a cart-wheel passing over
it.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Emberiza Cirlus</span> [<i>The Cirl Bunting</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very rarely found in this quarter.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla cœlebs</span> [<i>The Chaffinch</i>]. Abundant.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla montifringilla</span> [<i>The Brambling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter visitor. A few may be met with every season.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla montana</span> [<i>The Tree Sparrow</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">To be found in several localities throughout the county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla domestica</span> [<i>The House Sparrow</i>]. Numerous.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla chloris</span> [<i>The Green Finch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Pretty generally distributed throughout the country, and especially
in woody places. The bird is easily tamed.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla coccothraustes</span> [<i>The Hawfinch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A rare bird with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla ciris</span> [<i>The Painted Finch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A migratory species. Only one specimen has been seen.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla carduelis</span> [<i>The Goldfinch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These birds have in a great measure been captured by the bird-catchers.
(See <a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla spinus</span> [<i>The Siskin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Fewer than before. They have been thinned by the bird-catchers.
A tamable bird.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla cannabina</span> [<i>The Linnet</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">There is no house bird that possesses so many names as this one.
It is the rose lintie so long as it retains its red breast; but
when that is gone or wanting, it is then the gray lintie, the
whin lintie, the brown lintie, and so on. Cultivation is driving
the linties away, by tearing down every whin, knoll, and brae,
where it is possible for the plough and spade to work their way.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla linaria</span> [<i>The Lesser Redpole</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is found most plentifully in the higher districts of the
county; but in severe winters, large flocks of them descend to
the lower grounds.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla borealis</span> [<i>The Mealy Redpole</i>]. A rare species.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fringilla montium</span> [<i>The Twite</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Another mountain as well as sea-shore rocky species. It is the
most elegant of all our linnets.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Loxia pyrrhula</span> [<i>The Bullfinch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another prize for the trapper. But great numbers are
annually destroyed by gardeners and nurserymen, who believe
that they are destructive. Yet their principal food consists of
insects; and insects are also the chief food for their young. I
hope a better day will arrive for these lovely little birds, when
they will be cherished and encouraged rather than hated and
destroyed. The bullfinch is easily taught to whistle, or to
“pipe” familiar tunes.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Loxia curvivostra</span> [<i>The Crossbill</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird is on the increase. They nest with us, and have done
so for some years. There is a great diversity of colour and
size amongst them.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Loxia pytiopsittacus</span> [<i>Parrot Crossbill</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">While walking one morning round the Whinhill, and just as I
reached the south side, I was rather surprised at hearing the
voice of what I knew to be a stranger. On looking to a low,
bare wall, about three or four yards in front of me, I beheld,
in all his pride and beauty, a male parrot crossbill. This is
the only instance, to my knowledge, of its existence amongst
us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Loxia leucoptera</span> [<i>White-Winged Crossbill</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">About fifty years ago, a large flock of these birds suddenly made
their appearance on the “Castle trees,” in this neighbourhood.
Their strange appearance and gaudy plumage soon attracted
notice,—nearly the whole town flocking to see the “foreigners.”
They appeared quite exhausted, many of them dropping from
the trees.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sturnus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Starling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The starling has been rapidly increasing of late years. At one time
single starlings were rarely to be seen, whereas flocks of this
bird now appear towards the close of every season.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sturnus predatorius</span> [<i>The Red-Winged Starling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A pretty bird which occasionally visits this county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Pastor roseus</span> [<i>Rose-Coloured Pastor</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another rare beauty, occasionally seen in this county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus corax</span> [<i>The Raven</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A few of these birds inhabit the precipitous parts of the coast,
where they breed in company with the falcon, kestrel, gull,
guillemot, etc. The raven will tame pretty well; it will talk
hoarsely, and do mischievous tricks.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus corone</span> [<i>Carrion Crow</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus cornix</span> [<i>Hooded Crow</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Both occur in about equal numbers. (See <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus frugilegus</span> [<i>The Rook</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Many large rookeries exist in the county. (See <a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus monedula</span> [<i>The Jackdaw</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Very plentiful. (See <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Corvus pica</span> [<i>Magpie</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One of the most bashful of birds. It is very sparingly distributed,
and in some places is scarcely known. Our keepers both shoot
and trap them wherever found.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Picus major</span> [<i>Greater Spotted Woodpecker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several pairs of this showy bird have been procured within our
district. It is also found in the higher parts of the county.
A specimen was shot near Banff, and when dissected, its
stomach was found crammed with two species of grub, of a
creamy or grayish colour. It contained also several beetles and
a small spider.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Picus minor</span> [<i>Lesser Spotted Woodpecker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">More rare than the last. One sent to me, fourteen years since,
from Mayen, where it was shot, and another seen on the Lodge
hills, are all that I am aware of. Very probably others have
occurred.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Yunx torquilla</span> [<i>Wryneck</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The late Professor Macgillivray, of Marischal College, Aberdeen,
informed me that one was taken at or near Portsoy, by a pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
of his. One, now in the Banff Museum, was taken six years
ago, about fourteen miles from the town.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Certhia familiaris</span> [<i>Creeper</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Wherever there are suitable woods, these birds are sure to be
found. We sometimes read and hear as extraordinary occurrences,
that nests have been found in the hearts of trees that
have been sawn up. Now, to those acquainted with the facts,
these occurrences are easily accounted for. I know a tree
myself which contains <i>two</i> nests, both with eggs. About seventeen
years ago there was in the side of this tree a small aperture,
about six feet from the ground, which led downwards to a cavity
in the centre of the trunk. The opening was so narrow outwardly
that it only admitted two of my fingers, but widened as
it proceeded to the bottom, a distance of about eighteen inches.
In this hole, at the time referred to, a pair of creepers built
their nest and laid eggs, after which they disappeared. Next
season a pair of blue titmice acted in a similar manner; and
they also disappeared, doubtless in consequence of being tormented
by boys, and of the narrowness of the entrance. The
growth of the tree caused the hole to get less and less every
year, and it has been for several years so completely closed that
the point of the finest needle cannot be inserted. The tree,
a sturdy beech, has the two nests and eggs in its very core. It
is thus evident how easily these “extraordinary occurrences”
may be accounted for.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Troglodytes Europæus</span> [<i>Wren</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The dear little wren, the lion of small birds, with his short, jerking
little tail, I have known and admired from childhood. Who
that has trod the woods in spring or summer has not heard a
very loud, though by no means inharmonious song, proceeding
from some bush or bank, and not admired it?—and who is there,
if he did not know the bird, that would not be surprised beyond
measure at so small a creature being able to make such a loud
noise? Of all the deserted nests I have ever met with, those of
the wren would, I am sure, count twenty per cent over any
other species. I am unable to account for this, but perhaps it
arises from their building several before they get one to please
them. I once found one of their nests in an old tin kettle,
which had become fixed amongst the branches of a holly. The
wren, like other birds, does not sing so well in confinement.
When in their native haunts, there is a pathos in their voice
and a music in their melody, which makes the heart thrill with
pleasure.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Upupa epops</span> [<i>Hoopoe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Three or four of these pretty birds have occurred here: one was
taken at Duff House, in 1832, by a Mr. Mackay, in such a state
of exhaustion as to allow itself to be captured by hand; another
was seen by myself, a few years back, in the same place; and
two others are said to have been since obtained in other parts of
the county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cuculus canorus</span> [<i>Cuckoo</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another sweet and darling gem. Well do I remember,
when only a little fellow, rummaging about the Den of Rubislaw,
near Aberdeen, how surprised I was on hearing the sound of
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” from a small plantation close by, and how
overjoyed I was when I obtained a sight of the bird; and now
that I am old, the sweet voice of the harbinger of sunny days
still cheers me. They are not very numerous with us along
the sea-coast, but are very frequent in the higher districts.
They generally appear about the end of April. It is said that
they can retain their eggs for a number of days after they are
ready for extrusion. I will relate, without comment, a circumstance
of this sort which came under my own observation:—A
female specimen, shot in a garden here, was brought to me to
be preserved. On dissecting it, I was agreeably surprised at
finding in the oviduct an egg as perfect as if it had been obtained
from a nest.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Coracias garrula</span> [<i>Roller</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am only aware of one specimen of this pretty and rare bird being
obtained in our county; it was a splendid specimen killed on the
hills of Boyndie.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Merops apiaster</span> [<i>Bee-Eater</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I give this species a place here from having heard that a greenish
bird, somewhat less than a thrush, with a longish bent bill, and
with two feathers of the tail longer than the rest, was killed in
a garden between Huntly and Dufftown, about seven years ago.
It has since been found at the hills of Boyndie, about two miles
from Banff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alcedo ispida</span> [<i>Kingfisher</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several of these sparkling gems have been taken here at different
times. (See <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hirundo rustica</span> [<i>Swallow</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hirundo riparia</span> [<i>Martin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These birds are in about equal numbers. The latter generally
nestles in the corners of windows, the former in barns, etc.;
they also breed along the sea-shore wherever there is a cave or
projecting rock suitable. White and cream-coloured varieties
are sometimes met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hirundo urbica</span> [<i>Sand Martin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Wherever there is a bank of any height and not too hard, whether
along the sea-shore or river-side, or a quarry or sand-hole, a
colony of these active little creatures are almost sure to be met
with during summer. It is surprising to see how they perforate
these places, and the depth to which they will sometimes go,
especially when we consider the remarkably feeble instruments
with which they do it—namely, a very small and slender bill,
and feet equally small and tender.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cypselus apus</span> [<i>Swift</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Of all our migratory species this is generally the last to arrive, and
the first to depart. Next to the skylark, the swift appears to
ascend highest in his aerial flights; and a very beautiful sight it
is to see it, on a clear, still evening, gambolling about so far
above the earth, and, it may be, screaming its farewell requiem
to the departing sun. The swift is the first to depart, towards
the end of August or beginning of September, and it returns
about the middle of May; the sand martin next, or about the
second or third week in September, and it usually returns about
the third week in April; and the swallow and house martin
commonly about the first week or middle of October, and it reappears
about the 1st of May. Before I part with this interesting
tribe I must become a little arithmetical. We are frequently
told, and justly, of the great benefit swallows and other insect-feeders
do, by the countless herds of noxious creatures which
they destroy. I will relate an instance of my own experience
in this respect. Picking up a swallow which had been
shot by a friend, I found that its mouth was crammed with
gnats and flies. Some of them were alive. They all seemed
attached to the mouth by a glutinous fluid. The bird had
apparently been catering for its young. Being desirous of
making a further examination, I wrapped it in paper and put
it in my pocket. On reaching home I opened the paper,
when a number of the gnats buzzed out into my face, much to
my regret; but I succeeded in counting upwards of 70, and I
am quite sure there were more than 100 in all. Now it is a
well-known fact that both birds assist in rearing their young.
Well, say that they visit the nest every ten minutes (which is
under the mark), and that every time of doing so, each bird
conveys 70 insects; this in an hour amounts to 840; in a day
of twelve hours, which is but a short day for a swallow at that
season of the year, to 10,080; in a week of seven days, to
70,560; and in a fortnight, to 141,120. But if we carry the
calculation a little further, by supposing that the birds rear two
broods in a season, although the number is often three, we
have, at the ratio at which we have been counting, a total of
282,240 insects destroyed in one year by <i>two birds alone</i>, while
rearing their two broods!</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Caprimulgus Europæus</span> [<i>Nightjar</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Of late years this species would appear to have become more
numerous, but it is still very far from plentiful.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Columba palumbus</span> [<i>Ring Dove</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Or, as we have it, <i>Cushie Doo</i>. This bids fair to become one of
the greatest pests of the farmers. The wild pigeons have increased
amazingly within the last few years, and the damage
they do is incalculable. This increase is caused by the almost
total destruction of the hawk tribe, which tended greatly to thin
their numbers.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Columba livia</span> [<i>Rock Dove</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A few pairs breed in the caverns along our coast. It is a rare case,
however, to get a pure specimen; as domestic pigeons from the
farms near, sometimes breed with them. I have seen white
specimens, as well as those of a sand colour.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Columba turtur</span> [<i>Turtle Dove</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Three or four specimens of this species are said to have been seen,
and some of them obtained, within the county; but whether wild
ones, or individuals that had escaped, has not been ascertained.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Phasianus colchicus</span> [<i>Pheasant</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Introduced, but seems to thrive very well; it is a beautiful ornament
to parks and woods. Partially pied varieties sometimes
occur, and another called the “silver pheasant.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tetrao tetrix</span> [<i>Black Grouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Exists chiefly in the higher districts.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tetrao Scoticus</span> [<i>Red Grouse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Exists on all our moors and hills, but not in great numbers.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tetrao lagopus</span> [<i>Ptarmigan</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Less frequent than either of the two last. Ptarmigans inhabit
the summits of our highest mountains; they are seldomer seen
than those which frequent the lower ground. Like all others
of the grouse tribe, they are yearly decreasing in number.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Perdix cinerea</span> [<i>Partridge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Pretty common. A very cunning and faithful mother is the
female; for when she has eggs she never goes out, if time permits,
without hiding them so carefully that it is almost impossible
to detect their whereabouts; and if you take her by surprise,
away she hobbles on one leg, and a wing trailing on the
ground as if wounded. (See <a href="#Page_254">p. 254</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Perdix rufa</span> [<i>The Red-legged Partridge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Commonly called the French Partridge; it has been recently found
in Banff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Perdix coturnix</span> [<i>Quail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">That this species is a regular visitor I am not prepared to say;
but that it is an occasional visitor and breeds here is beyond
all doubt. Nests and eggs of this species are sometimes met
with in cutting grass; they are generally passed over as those of
the landrail.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Charadrius pluvialis</span> [<i>Golden Plover</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Where moorfowl occur, the golden plover is generally to be met
with. When the hills, heaths, and fields are covered with snow,
the plover comes down from his alpine abode, and stays at the
sea-side, where great numbers fall an easy prey to the gun of
the sea-side fowler.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Charadrius morinellus</span> [<i>Dotterel</i>].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></div><div class="hang2">Occasionally met with. On once asking an old keeper from the
higher grounds as to where this species breeds, he replied,
“On the gray slopes of the highest mountains, far above all the
other birds, except the ptarmigan.” I am doubtful whether it
breeds with us at all.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Charadrius hiaticula</span> [<i>Ringed Plover</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These breed with us, and remain all the year round. I have found
their eggs on the sand by the beach, and forty miles inland.
They likewise nestle on the shingly banks and islands along our
river-courses. They are known here by the names of “sea
lark” and “sanny liverock.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Vanellus melanogaster</span> [<i>Gray Plover</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rather rare, and I believe only a winter visitor.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Vanellus cristatus</span> [<i>Lapwing</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Found on heaths and moors, and in fields, where they breed.
Many of them leave us towards winter. This is another species
which endeavours to mislead you when searching for its eggs.
Of all our field and heath birds, the lapwing is one of the most
useful in destroying destructive insects, such as <i>Zabrus
gibbus</i>, etc.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Strepsilas interpres</span> [<i>Turnstone</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">An occasional visitor, generally in winter. (See <a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Calidris arenaria</span> [<i>Sanderling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A regular visitor, generally arriving in August, a few of them
remaining through the winter. I have met with them, too, in
summer, when their predominant colour, instead of being
whitish, is a most beautiful reddish fawn. On their first
arrival here they are very tame, allowing you to approach
within a yard or two. (See <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hæmatopus ostralegus</span> [<i>Oystercatcher</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Why this bird is called oystercatcher, I cannot understand. Had
it been named “limpetcatcher” I could have understood it. I
have crawled amongst the rocks in order to see them feed; when
I have seen the limpet driven from its hold, and scooped out of
its shell with as much apparent ease as I could have picked up
a <i>Gammaris locusta</i>; but I have never seen it attempt to catch
an oyster. On this part of the coast its food generally consists
of the limpet, and very rarely of <i>Acmæa testitudinalis</i>. I have
counted as many as forty-one of the former in the stomach of a
single bird, whilst of the latter I have not met with more than
three or four examples. The oystercatcher is a summer visitor
with us, arriving here to breed. Now and then it may be seen
during winter. Large flocks visit us some seasons, generally in
September, and after remaining for a day proceed farther south.
“Sea piet” is the name the bird is known by here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ardea cinerea</span> [<i>Heron</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">We have some small spots where these birds breed, but which
hardly deserve the name of heronries. At one time, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
they were in greater numbers. I remember taking from the
stomach of one a large water-rat, three middle-sized trout, and
fifteen minnows. Some time ago, a person belonging to this
town, whilst passing through one of the streets, was startled at
being hit on the head by something which had fallen from
above, and which proved to be a small fish, the five-bearded
rockling, apparently quite fresh. On looking up he saw
nothing but a “craigie” passing over the houses, pursued by a
number of crows. Of course the fish had dropped from the
heron; but the man could not be persuaded that it had not
dropped from the clouds.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ardea purpurea</span> [<i>Purple Heron</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One of these birds is said to have been shot about thirteen miles
from hence. My late friend, the Rev. Mr. Smith, saw fragments
of the bird some time afterwards, and believed it to be of this
species.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ardea egretta</span> [<i>Great White Heron</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Two of these birds were observed to frequent various parts of our
coast about twenty-six years ago; but a specimen has not since
been procured.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ardea stellaris</span> [<i>Bittern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Three or four of these birds are known to have paid us a visit.
One in the Banff Museum, a very pretty one, was killed near
Banff about twenty-four years since; another in the Moss of
Park, and one or two at Balveny.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platalea leucorodia</span> [<i>Spoonbill</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One of these rarities was found in a ditch in a wood near here, by
a young naturalist; he says it could easily have been shot, for
he approached quite close to it, and it did not appear at all shy.
It has since been found in this neighbourhood.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ibis falcinellus</span> [<i>Glossy Ibis</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">On one occasion I perceived three of these birds hovering about
the coast for a whole day, but I could not get a shot at them;
it was in winter and during a very severe storm.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Numenius arquata</span> [<i>Curlew</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful in certain localities along the shore in winter; they retire
in spring to the alpine and sub-alpine districts Their note
in winter is simply “Whaup,” with sometimes a loud scream when
come upon suddenly. In summer, however, and whilst among
the moors and hills, it is more varied, being then “Poo-l-ie,
poo-l-ie,” then “Coor-lie, coor-lie,” with a long “Wha-a-up”
at the end. They are not then so shy as when seen by the
sea-shore.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Numenius phæopus</span> [<i>Whimbrel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Seldom a summer passes but a whimbrel or two may be met
with along the shore, and sometimes in some of our mosses. I
think they breed with us. They are generally very shy, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
easily approached. Their call-note at once distinguishes them
from the curlew.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Totanus caldris</span> [<i>Redshank</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">We have this red and long-legged gentleman rather sparingly with
us, but we have him all the year. There are certain spots coastwise
not much frequented, where, for seven or eight months in
the year, you will seldom if ever fail to meet with a few; and
when disturbed their wild scream accords well with the solitary
places which they frequent, especially where there is a low
hollow murmuring from the ocean. This is another species,
which, lapwing-like, will flap about you when in the way of their
nest, and for noise they exceed them completely. They generally
breed in marshy and boggy places and about the grassy
margins of lochs, but I have also found them amongst bents
and dry sandy places by the sea-shore.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Totanus hypoleucos</span> [<i>Common Sandpiper</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The common sandpiper (or, as we have it, “Kittie-needie,” from
its cry) is one of our summer birds; there is scarcely one of our
streams but has its “kittie-needies” in the season. They breed
on the banks.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Totanus glottis</span> [<i>Greenshank</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is a rarity with us. I have one in my possession, out of two
which were shot in the moss of Banff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Recurvirostra avocetta</span> [<i>Avocet</i>]. More rare than the preceding.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Limosa melanura</span> [<i>Blacktailed Godwit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Only two specimens have been taken here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Limosa rufa</span> [<i>Bartailed Godwit</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A few of these may generally be observed every autumn, either by
the sea-side or in our mosses. They do not stop long with us;
a few days at most sufficing. Perhaps we have not suitable
localities for them.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Machetes pugnax</span> [<i>Ruff</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. Three, I think, have been obtained, all birds of the year,
and all in autumn.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scolopax rusticola</span> [<i>Woodcock</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Though a pair or two have been known to breed, the woodcock
can hardly rank with us but as a winter visitor. In some
seasons they are more numerous than in others. Does the snow
affect the colouring of this species? My reason for asking this
question is because, in very severe and snowy weather, I have
seen many of them of a remarkably light colour; but in milder
seasons, and when there were little or no storms or frost, I have
never seen any of them with the same gray-like coating.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scolopax gallinago</span> [<i>Common Snipe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Though many of these breed and remain with us all the year, still
we receive great additions annually from elsewhere, and generally
towards the end of autumn; but neither during summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
nor winter are they so plentiful as they were. Drainage is said
to be the cause of their comparative scarcity.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scolopax grisea</span> [<i>The Brown Snipe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Some specimens of this bird have been met with near Banff, but it
is rarely seen.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scolopax gallinula</span> [<i>Jack Snipe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter visitor only, so far as I am aware,—and by no means so
numerous as the preceding. The jack snipe would appear to
be a solitary animal; at least I have never seen more than two
of them together (of course in winter), but more commonly only
one; in fact, they are nearly always seen single. Unlike the
others, however, I have seen them return to the same spot three
times, after being as often fired at.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa subarquata</span> [<i>Curlew Sandpiper</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only met with one specimen of which I can speak with
certainty.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa canutus</span> [<i>Knot</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A few generally visit us every autumn on their southward passage.
They are remarkably easy of approach.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa minuta</span> [<i>Little Stint</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A very fine little fellow. I once had a desperate hunt after one.
(See <a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa temminckii</span> [<i>Temminck’s Stint</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Mr. Taylor, gamekeeper to the Earl of Fife, once shot a specimen
on the Deveron bank.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa variabilis</span> [<i>Dunlin</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This bird breeds in a few of our marshy places, and may now and
then be met with along the coast. Towards autumn large
flocks appear, but they do not remain long. Specimens may be
picked up occasionally, during winter, almost pure white, except
the bill, legs, and feet, which retain their usual colour. This
species appears to differ considerably in size, the legs and bills
included,—the larger birds often having the shortest bills.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tringa maritima</span> [<i>Purple Sandpiper</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A rock-loving species whilst with us, never leaving the rocks unless
from necessity. They are gregarious, and huddle so closely
together that I have known as many as twenty-three killed at
one shot. I have killed them occasionally during summer, their
colour being then of a rufous or rusty character, or more like
that of the dunlin, the purple gloss and dark gray plumage of
winter having all but disappeared.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gallinula crex</span> [<i>Landrail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">“Corn craig” or “crake.” Very sparingly distributed here. It
arrives generally at the beginning of May, and departs usually
in September, but I have seen it as late as December. These
birds often feign themselves dead, when hard pressed, rather
than fly,—a fact that may seem incredible to those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
paid no attention to such things. Is it possible that these
birds remove their eggs on its coming to their knowledge that
their nests have been discovered? I knew of a nest which contained
seven eggs. I took one, and, wishing to get all that the
hen would lay, left the remainder untouched; I also carefully
obliterated all my foot-marks, to prevent others from suspecting
anything if the nest was found. I went back three days afterwards,
when, although there were no signs of human footprints,
all the eggs were gone.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gallinula pusilla</span> [<i>Little Crake</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Only one of this British rarity has been procured here, so far as I
know. It occurred at a place called Thornton, on the banks of
the Isla.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gallinula chloropus</span> [<i>Moorhen</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The “waterhen.” In consequence of our having but few lochs,
and those very small, we have not many of this species. As
skulkers, they almost rival the landrail.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rallus aquaticus</span> [<i>Water Rail</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Far more scarce than the last; in fact it is almost a rarity.
Perhaps their skulking habits prevent their being oftener seen.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Fulica atra</span> [<i>Coot</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">An occasional visitor. On the loch of Strathbeg (Aberdeenshire),
where they are pretty numerous, they breed, and remain all
the year round. In very wet summers the water of this loch
rises at times considerably above the usual level; on such
occasions I have seen the coot sailing nobly along with her
nest beneath her.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Phalaropus platyrhynchus</span> [<i>Gray Phalarope</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Three specimens were procured on the sands of Sandend.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Phalaropus hyperboreus</span> [<i>Rednecked Phalarope</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One specimen, a male, was shot on the beach here, in the spring
of 1855.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anser.</span></div>

<div class="hang2">Of the genus Anser we are remarkably scanty. Several kinds of
geese have from time to time been procured, and not an autumn
or spring passes without many large flocks being seen passing
and repassing, but to what species they belong it is difficult
to say. That the <i>Graylag</i> (<span class="smcap">Anser ferus</span>), the <i>Brent</i> (<span class="smcap">A.
bernicla</span>), the <i>Egyptian</i> (<span class="smcap">A. Ægyptiacus</span>), and the <i>Spur-winged</i>
(<span class="smcap">A. gambensis</span>), have been met with, is beyond doubt;
but that these are all that have visited us, it is hard to say.
The <i>Brent</i> is very numerous in certain seasons along the coast.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cygnus.</span></div>

<div class="hang2">The genus Cygnus is still more scantily represented. Some of
them visit us in passing to and from their breeding grounds.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas tadorna</span> [<i>Common Shieldrake</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This pretty bird is only a winter visitor with us, and then not in
large numbers.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas clypeata</span> [<i>Shoveller</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This pretty bird is quite a rarity here. In the latter part of
the winter of 1837-8, which was of great severity, a mutilated
specimen of the shoveller was found dead amongst the rocks at
Blackpots.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas strepera</span> [<i>Gadwall</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Another great rarity, so far as I am aware; one, a female, procured
in the Deveron by Dr. Leslie, about the time the shoveller above
alluded to was picked up, is the only one I know of.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas acuta</span> [<i>Pintail Duck</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I remember being roused rather early one morning, many years
ago, by a loud knocking at the street door, and a person calling
at the top of his voice, “Rise, man, Tam! I’ve brought a rare
bird t’ ye—a Duke.” Being awake, I immediately jumped up.
On seeing the bird, I was delighted to observe a beautiful male
pintail. It had been shot that night on the Deveron.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas boschas</span> [<i>Wild Duck</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful, especially in winter. Among the sandy bents almost
close to the ocean’s verge, and on the tops of our heath-clad
hills and moors, I have found this species breeding; as well as
on a tree about thirteen feet from the ground, and on a rock in
the craigs of Alvah. This latter nest was placed on a ledge fully
thirty feet above the water, and had eight or nine feet of perpendicular
rock above it. There is a hill near here, which I
believe they used frequently to nestle on, but which they have
now quite deserted—viz. Fern or Whin Hill, better known as
Gallow Hill. It was on this hill,—or rather piece of ground, for
it hardly deserves the name of hill,—that the celebrated free-booter
M’Pherson finished his earthly career. It is a rough
and stony place where he lies, covered with heath and whin.
The pheasant and wild duck used not unfrequently to breed on
his very grave. On a small island on the Deveron stood a tall
old poplar. About five feet from the ground it divided into
two arms, one stretching upwards, whilst the other bent over
the river, and it is with this one that I am now concerned. In
1839 the Deveron, like the other rivers in Scotland, rose far
above its usual height, so far indeed that it reached the arm
of the tree alluded to, on which it deposited a good deal of
rubbish. A female wild duck built her nest, a few years afterwards,
amongst the <i>debris</i> thus left, and succeeded in rearing a
brood of thirteen young ones. Neither nest nor bird, though
known of by some salmon-fishers who had a station close by,
was disturbed. One morning the female was observed by
these men to leave her nest and fly up and down the water in
an unusual manner. Presently she was joined by the male,
and both disappeared beneath a bank a little above where the
nest was. The fishermen, who had watched them, observed the
female reappear alone, and, after flying up and down once or
twice, again settled down on the water, just below the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
which contained the nest. After sailing about for a few
minutes, she was heard to give a “quack,” when down went
something into the water, and presently a young one was seen
by her side. Away she swam with it to the bank referred to,
consigning it to the charge of the male; after which she returned,
and, having again sailed about for a short time, gave
another “quack,” when down came another youngster, which
she also led away to the bank. In this way she continued until
all were safely removed. The female never gave more than one
“quack,” and she never carried more than one young one at a
time; nor did she return after taking away the thirteenth.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas querquedula</span> [<i>Garganey</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Two specimens of this species were shot in December 1840; and
one is said to have been obtained at Cullen, in the spring of
1841.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas crecca</span> [<i>Teal</i>]. Occasionally met with in winter.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas Penelope</span> [<i>Wigeon</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One of our rarest duck visitors. A splendid male specimen was
killed at Boyndie in September 1853.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas Americana</span> [<i>American Wigeon</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A mutilated male specimen of this rare duck, shot on the Burn of
Boyndie, in January 1841, was for many years in my possession.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas marila</span> [<i>Scaup Duck</i>]. Pretty frequent during winter.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas fuligula</span> [<i>Tufted Duck</i>]. Very rare.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas clangula</span> [<i>Goldeneye</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A regular winter visitor, generally coast-wise, but they are also
met with on mill-dams some miles inland.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anas glacialis</span> [<i>Long-tailed Duck</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Abundant, but always keeping near the coast. I have shot them
when in their full breeding dress, which gives them quite a
different appearance. In spring they are very clamorous,
pursuing each other through the water, and diving and skipping
about like Merry Andrews. The noise they make on such
occasions is so loud that I have heard it, on a still morning,
nearly three miles off. They are generally among the first birds
to arrive and the last to leave.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mergus cucullatus</span> [<i>Hooded Merganser</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I was told by an old gunner and bird-stuffer that he had shot a
specimen of this species, but I cannot vouch for his accuracy.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mergus serrator</span> [<i>Redbreasted Merganser</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Not very plentiful. All along the coast, in suitable localities,
they are met with, singly, and two or three together, rarely
more.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mergus merganser</span> [<i>Goosander</i>].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></div><div class="hang2">A winter visitor. The male is a very showy gentleman. As
many as seven or eight specimens were procured at one shot, on
the Deveron. I have seen as many as live or six together.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Podiceps cristatus</span> [<i>Great Crested Grebe</i>]. An occasional visitor.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Podiceps rubricollis</span> [<i>Rednecked Grebe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Of more frequent occurrence, but generally in immature plumage.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Podiceps auritus</span> [<i>Eared Grebe</i>]. Less frequent than the last.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Podiceps minor</span> [<i>Little Grebe</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter seldom passes without an opportunity occurring to
obtain this species. It is one of the most expert divers we have.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Colymbus glacialis</span> [<i>Great Northern Diver</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Some seasons pretty plentiful. Splendid specimens are at times
procured, but they are generally immature.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Colymbus arcticus</span> [<i>Blackthroated Diver</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Colymbus septentrionalis</span> [<i>Redthroated Diver</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Winter visitors, in about equal numbers. A few of them gradually
fall victims every spring to getting entangled in the bag-nets
set for salmon. They not unfrequently visit our larger streams,
where they make great havoc among the smaller of the finny
tribe.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Uria Brunnichii</span> [<i>Brunnich’s Guillemot</i>] has been once met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Uria troile</span> [<i>Common Guillemot</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Uria lachrymans</span> [<i>Ringed Guillemot</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Uria grylle</span> [<i>Black Guillemot</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mormon fratercula</span> [<i>Puffin</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alca torda</span> [<i>Razorbill</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">All these species breed with us, but the black guillemot only
rarely. I have procured several ringed guillemots both in
winter and summer; I have also been shown places in the cliffs
where the fishermen say they breed.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alca alle</span> [<i>Little Auk</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A winter visitor. In December 1846 a terrific sea-storm raged
here for the greater part of the month; at its termination I
counted between the Burn of Boyne and Greenside of Gamrie,
a distance of about nine miles, nearly sixty of these little birds
lying dead, besides a number of guillemots and razorbills.
Great numbers were also found dead in the fields throughout
the county.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Carbo cormoranus</span> [<i>Cormorant</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent, except for a short time during summer. A pair or two
may breed with us, but that is all. Like the divers, they
destroy great numbers of fish.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Carbo cristatus</span> [<i>Shag</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Only, I believe, an occasional visitor.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sula bassana</span> [<i>Gannet</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A spring and autumn visitor, and occasionally during summer and
winter. When overtaken, as they sometimes are, by strong
north winds, I have known them driven to great distances
inland, where they are frequently seen lying dead. Immature
specimens are now and then procured during their autumnal
passage. From their different plumage they are looked upon as
distinct from the “solan goose,” as the gannet is here called.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna cantiaca</span> [<i>Sandwich Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">An occasional visitor, generally in summer.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna Dougallii</span> [<i>Roseate Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Two specimens have been obtained between Banff and Cullen.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna Hirundo</span> [<i>Common Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna arctica</span> [<i>Arctic Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Annual visitors, generally in autumn. During some seasons
they come in immense numbers. Although they do not breed
with us, they do so on part of the sandy shores of the adjoining
counties of Aberdeen and Moray.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna minuta</span> [<i>Lesser Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This pretty little lady-like bird does not breed with us, but does
so in the places mentioned for the two preceding. It is only
an occasional visitor.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sterna nigra</span> [<i>Black Tern</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I know of only one instance of its having been found here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus Sabini</span> [<i>Sabine’s Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I had an exciting chase after a specimen, but failed in capturing
it; it was the only one I have seen or heard of here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus minutus</span> [<i>Little Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I believe only two specimens have been met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus capistratus</span> [<i>Masked Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am informed that two of these birds were killed about thirty
years ago.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus ridibundus</span> [<i>Black-headed Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like the common and arctic terns, this species, although it has
no breeding-grounds with us, breeds on either side in great
numbers, and is a frequent visitor here, chiefly in spring and
autumn.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus tridactylus</span> [<i>Kittiwake</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Breeds with us, but not in such numbers as formerly.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus eburneus</span> [<i>Ivory Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several specimens have been shot near Gamrie. It is a polar bird,
almost pure white.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus canus</span> [<i>Common Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Abundant during winter and spring. The gull may be met with
all the year round, though I believe it does not breed with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus leucopterus</span> [<i>Iceland Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Sometimes, during winter, a specimen of this northern bird may
be obtained, but mostly in an immature state of plumage.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus fuscus</span> [<i>Lesser Blackbacked Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Met with now and then, but not in great plenty. It does not
nestle here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus argentatus</span> [<i>Herring Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Breeds at Gamrie Head and at Troup. Numbers are taken when
young by the fishermen and their children, and brought up
quite tame, walking about the villages like poultry.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus marinus</span> [<i>Great Blackbacked Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like his lesser brethren, this gentleman is but a visitor here, and
generally goes before he gets his black coat.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Larus glaucus</span> [<i>Glaucous Gull</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A female, in an immature state of plumage, was killed in Gamrie.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lestus catarractes</span> [<i>Common Skua</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lestus Richardsoni</span> [<i>Richardson’s Skua</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Both are to be met with as visitors, the latter the rarer of the two.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Procellaria glacialis</span> [<i>Fulmar Petrel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">An occasional winter visitor. I had a specimen sent me from
Gamrie, which approached a boat so closely that one of the
fishermen knocked it down with an oar; this was several miles
out at sea.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Puffinus major</span> [<i>Great Shearwater</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Puffinus obscurus</span> [<i>Dusky Shearwater</i>]. Only winter visitors.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Thalassidroma pelagica</span> [<i>Stormy Petrel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A visitor, like the rest of its kindred, but more frequent, and may
be met with at intervals all the year round. The superstitious
dread of this little bird by sailors and fishermen is well known.</div>











<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the stormy petrel ends my List of the Birds of Banffshire.
Many species given as “rare” may turn out to be of frequent occurrence,
and many given as “occasional visitors” may prove to be
natives. Species, too, not mentioned in this List may have to be included
in the birds of the county; and no one will be more pleased to
hear of such additions than myself.</p>


<h3>FISHES.</h3>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Labrax lupus</span> [<i>The Basse or Sea Perch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is a rare species with us, only three having come under my
notice. One of these, a beautiful specimen, was found dead in
our river, the Deveron, not far from its mouth, in 1839.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acerina vulgaris</span> [<i>The Ruffe or Pope</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One is said to have been obtained off Troup Head about forty-two
years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trachinus draco</span> [<i>The Great Weever</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Occasionally found. The fish is said to be possessed of very
poisonous qualities, insomuch that a prick or even a mere scratch
from either of the rays (which are hard and spinous) of the first
dorsal or back fin, causes the severest pain imaginable. On
the continent, where they are more numerous than they are here,
and where they are used as an article of food, there is a very
stringent law which forbids them being brought to market, or
even exposed for sale in any shape whatever, unless these spines
are all cut off; and in order to enforce obedience, parties found
transgressing the law are severely punished.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trachinus vipera</span> [<i>The Little Weever</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Specimens of the little weever are not unfrequently met with;
which would seem to indicate that they are more numerous in
the Firth than the preceding.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mullus barbatus</span> [<i>The Bed Surmullet</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This and the striped red mullet (<span class="smcap">M. surmuletus</span>) have both
been obtained, the latter being the most frequent.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trigla cuculus</span> [<i>The Red Gurnard</i>] is pretty frequent; as is also</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trigla hirundo</span> [<i>The Sapphirine Gurnard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Some splendid specimens of this latter fish are annually brought
on shore by our fishermen towards the end of autumn.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trigla gurnardus</span> [<i>The Gray Gurnard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is our commonest gurnard; and, judging from the numbers
taken, must be very numerous. They are known here by the
term of ‘Crunack.’ They are not much esteemed as an article
of food, even among the peasants; and they are, in consequence,
seldom brought to market.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trigla pœciloptera</span> [<i>The Little Gurnard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Somewhat rare. I remember once taking one from the stomach of
a great northern diver, which was shot between Findochtie
and Speymouth, in the spring of 1840, and which was sent me
for the purpose of being preserved.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cottus scorpius</span> [<i>The Short-spined Cottus</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Pretty frequent.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cottus bubalis</span> [<i>The Long-spined Cottus</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rather plentiful. I find them in abundance, in pools left by
the tide, or beneath stones at low water. Many of them
exhibit some most beautiful markings.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cottus quadricornis</span> [<i>The Four-horned Cottus</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have never found this species but in the stomachs of other fish;
which leads me to conclude that they generally inhabit deep
water; or, at least, that they do not come so near the shore as
the preceding species.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Aspidophorus Europæus</span> [<i>The Armed Bullhead</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another stomach species. But I have found these, also,
though very sparingly, amongst the rocks at low tide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gasterosteus trachurus</span> [<i>The Rough-tailed, Three-spined Stickleback</i>]
and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gasterosteus leiurus</span> [<i>The Smooth-tailed Stickleback</i>] are both
plentiful. The former along the coast, and the latter in our
streams and rivulets.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Spinachia vulgaris</span> [<i>The Fifteen-spined Stickleback</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Common amongst the pools along the shore. I have seen this
species with sixteen and seventeen spines. They are known
amongst our fishermen by the very peculiar denomination of
“Willie-wan-beard.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Chrysophrys aurata</span> [<i>The Gilt-head</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only seen two specimens of this fish which have been procured
with us. The one was taken off Buckie in 1841; and
the other was brought on shore at Portsoy, in 1839. They
appear to be scarce, from the fact that the fishermen do not
know them.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Pagellus centrodontus</span> [<i>The Sea Bream</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is a more common species,—numbers appearing annually.
In some seasons they appear in greater abundance than in others.
They are sold here under the name of “Perch.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Brama Raii</span> [<i>Ray’s Bream</i>]. Rare.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cantharus griseus</span> [<i>The Black Bream</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A few of these are generally procured every autumn, or about the
beginning of winter. They are known and sold here under the
term of “Old Wife.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Dentex vulgaris</span> [<i>The Four-toothed Sparus</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Although this species, like many more, bears the name “<i>vulgaris</i>,”
or <i>common</i>, it is not so with us. I am only aware of one specimen,
which was taken off Troup Head.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scomber scomber</span> [<i>The Mackerel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This beautiful and highly prized fish generally appears on our
part of the coast about autumn,—in some seasons, in great
plenty,—in others, not so numerous.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scomber colias?</span> (<i>The Spanish Mackerel?</i>)</div>

<div class="hang2">As will be seen, I have placed this species here as doubtful. A
mackerel differing in many respects from the one noted above,
and which agrees very well with <i>Scomber colias</i>, was taken off
Portknockie, but by the time I had the pleasure of seeing it, it
was a good deal disfigured. Still, as I have already said, it
exhibited many of the markings and other characteristics of
the Spanish Mackerel.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Thynnus vulgaris</span> (<i>The Tunny</i>).</div>

<div class="hang2">Several specimens of this fish have, from time to time, been taken
with us. A very large one was captured in a salmon-net at
Portsoy. It measured over nine feet in length, and six feet in
girth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Xiphias gladius</span> [<i>The Sword Fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A small specimen of this fish—rare on this part of the coast—was
caught in our harbour by a shrimper.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Naucrates ductor</span> [<i>The Pilot Fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A very fine specimen of this rare and rather peculiar fish was
taken in our bay some years ago, and was exhibited as a curiosity.
It was unknown in the place, and also to the person who
took it; but an old tar chancing to see it, who had seen some
service abroad, having hitched up his trousers, and rid his
mouth of a yard or two of tobacco juice, exclaimed, with something
of a knowing air—“Well, I’ll be blowed if that aint a
Pilot; and a pretty one it is, too. We used to see them often,
when sailing in the Mediterranean.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Caranx trachurus</span> [<i>The Scad or Horse Mackerel</i>], or, as it is
termed here, the “Buck Mackerel,” is not very numerous, and
is very seldom used as an article of food. Its appearance
here, is usually about the time of herring-fishing. I once
found a rather strange variety of this species. It was about
the usual size; but it was all over of a most beautiful golden
yellow, finely striped and variegated with numerous lines of
the brightest blue, except the fins, which were of the finest
carmine.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lampris guttatus</span> [<i>The Opah or King Fish</i>] has occurred on several
occasions; as off Troup Head, at Black Pots, on the shore near
Portsoy, and at Buckie.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Mugil capito</span> [<i>The Gray Mullet</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am only aware of two specimens of this Mullet which have been
procured within our limits; the one at Gardenstown, the other
at Cullen.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Blennius Montagui</span> [<i>Montagu’s Blenny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One specimen taken from the stomach of a haddock.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Blennius gattorugine</span> [<i>The Gattoruginous Blenny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have met with this species only on two occasions.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Blennius Yarrellii</span> [<i>Yarrell’s Blenny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rarely met with. I have a splendid specimen in my collection,
which was found cast on shore between Gardenstown and
Crovie.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Blennius pholis</span> [<i>The Shanny or Smooth Blenny</i>],</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gunnellus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Spotted Gunnel</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Zoarces viviparus</span> [<i>The Viviparous or Green Blenny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Are all to be met with amongst the low-lying rocks along our line
of shore.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anarrichas lupus</span> [<i>The Wolf Fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent, but seldom used as food. I find them pretty often
cast on shore dead, after a storm; which would seem to indicate
that their habitat is not always in deep water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius niger</span> [<i>The Black Goby</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These inhabiting the rocky parts of the coast, become, at times,
the prey of the haddock, etc. Though they do not seem to be
numerous in this arm of the sea, I meet with them occasionally
in the stomachs of fishes.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius minutus</span> [<i>The Freckled or Spotted Goby</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is another stomach species; as also the</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius Ruthensharri</span> [<i>The Double Spotted Goby</i>], which appears to
be the rarest of the three.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Callionymus lyra</span> [<i>The Gemmeous Dragonet</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This splendidly coloured fish is frequently met with; and the so-called</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Callionymus dracunculus</span> [<i>Sordid Dragonet</i>] is found in about
equal number; for it is a general maxim, that where the husband
is, there also should the wife be. Ichthyologists cling to
the idea that these fish are distinct species. Out of about
one hundred specimens which I have dissected, I have never
yet found anything like <i>roe</i> or <i>ova</i> in those having the long rays
on the first dorsal, and which are known as the Gemmeous;
and in like manner I have never yet met with anything at all
pertaining to a <i>milt</i> in those having the short rays, and which
are known as the Sordid Dragonet. My conclusion is that they
are only male and female of the same species.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lophius piscatorius</span> [<i>The Angler or Fishing Frog</i>, or, as it is called
here, the <i>Sea Devil</i>] is frequently met with, but is not used as
an article of food.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Labrus bergylta</span> [<i>The Ballan Wrasse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Pretty frequent during summer.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Labrus mixtus</span> [<i>The Blue Striped Wrasse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. A very pretty specimen was taken off Macduff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Crenilabrus melops</span> [<i>The Gilthead</i>]. Rare.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Crenilabrus rupestris</span> [<i>Jago’s Goldsinny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only seen one of this species in the neighbourhood. A
beautiful specimen which I found one winter’s day, was cast on
shore at the links.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acantholabrus exoletus</span> [<i>The Small-mouthed Wrasse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like the last, only one specimen of this fish has, as yet, come
under my notice, and that one was captured off Troup Head.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cyprinus auratus</span> [<i>The Gold and Silver Carps</i>, as they are termed],
have been introduced, and have thriven pretty well, as at
Macduff, where they have propagated to an amazing degree.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Leuciscus phoxinus</span> [<i>The Minnow</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This pretty active little fish is to be found in most of our streams.
It is curious to see it stated in works on Ichthyology that this
species is not to be met with north of the Dee, Aberdeenshire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Belone vulgaris</span> [<i>The Gar Fish</i>, or, as it is called here, “The
Greenbeen,”] is by no means scarce, at certain seasons.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scomberesox saurus</span> [<i>The Saury Pike</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Not so often met with as the last. In fact, it must be termed
rare.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Salmo salar</span> [<i>The Salmon</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This valuable and highly-prized fish is found both along our coast
and in our fresh waters. At one time, they were very numerous
in the Deveron. From a <i>pot</i> or <i>hole</i> which once existed a
little below the bridge which spans the river, at a little distance
from the sea, and not far from the town, as many as one hundred,
and sometimes more, have been taken at a haul. This was
before stake and bag nets were so thickly planted along our
sea-shore as they are now.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Salmo eriox</span> [<i>The Bull or Gray Trout</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Some large individuals of this species are often taken.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Salmo trutta</span> [<i>The Salmon Trout</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">These were at one time believed to be the young of the Salmon;
and the tacksman gave orders that they should not be taken.
Previously, they had been fished for with small-meshed nets,
and sold as Trout, under the name of “Finnock.” Time passed
and the river beheld another tacksman, who, differing from
his predecessor, gave orders that they should be again taken.
Accordingly, they are now annually fished for, and are once more
sold as “Sea Trout,” “White Trout,” and “Finnock.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Salmo fario</span> [<i>The Common Trout</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">In all our streams. These also are taken, and sold with the
last mentioned.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Osmerus eperlanus</span> [<i>The Smelt</i>]. Rare with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Clupea harengus</span> [<i>The Herring</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species abounds along this coast, towards the middle of
summer, and the beginning of autumn. The fry of this fish is
met with nearly all the year round.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Clupea Leachii</span> [<i>Leach’s Herring</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A rather smaller-sized herring than the common species. It is
generally met with in small shoals in May and June.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Clupea sprattus</span> [<i>The Sprat or Garnet Herring</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This is also met with about the same time, but in smaller numbers.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alosa finta</span> [<i>The Twaite Shad</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. A very fine specimen was taken in our river last summer,
about a mile from the sea.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alosa communis</span> [<i>The Alice Shad</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The same may be said of this species,—it is rare. They are
termed, “rock herring.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Morrhua vulgaris</span> [<i>The Cod</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It is to the stomach of this species that I am most indebted for
many of the rarer of the testaceous and crustaceous specimens
which I possess. (For the cod’s bill of fare see <a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>.) The
cod is extensively fished for along this part of the coast, and
may be termed <i>the poor man’s salmon</i>. Great numbers are
salted and dried, and in that state sent to the southern markets.
I have occasionally met with a cod of a red colour, in all save
the fins, which are generally of a yellowish tinge, and never
larger than a common sized haddock. They are known here by
the name of “rock codlings.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Morrhua œglefinus</span> [<i>The Haddock</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like the cod, it is extensively taken, and largely cured and forwarded
south. Our Buckie haddocks are well known for their
excellence, and are far famed for their superior qualities.
Like the cod, the stomach of this species is also a rich mine
for the Naturalist.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Morrhua lusca</span> [<i>The Bib or Whiting Pout</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent; but not often brought to market, although they are
most excellent eating. The fishermen generally cut them up
and use them as bait.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Morrhua minuta</span> [<i>The Power Cod</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Not known as an inhabitant of the Firth until recently. They
are excellent eating. It is a great pity that they are so small
and scarce.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Merlangus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Whiting</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Often taken, but not so much admired as the Haddock.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Merlangus pollachius</span> [<i>The Pollack or Lythe</i>]. Frequent.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Merlangus carbonarius</span> [<i>The Coal-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Like the last; when young, great numbers of them are occasionally
taken in our harbours, in small-meshed nets. They are termed
“Gerrocks.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Merlucius vulgaris</span> [<i>The Hake</i>]. Found occasionally.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lota molva</span> [<i>The Ling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Fished for with the cod, and cured in the same manner. When
salted and dried they are called “Kealing.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Motella quinquecirrata</span> [<i>The Five-bearded Rockling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent among the pools left among the rocks by the tide.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Motella cimbria</span> [<i>The Four-bearded Rockling</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. I have not met with it often.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Brosmius vulgaris</span> [<i>The Torsk or Tusk</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Taken with the cod and ling, and cured in the same fashion.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Phycis furcatus</span> [<i>The Great Forked Beard</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This fish is of rare occurrence with us, and that only at long intervals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa vulgaris</span> [<i>The Plaice</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful, and highly prized by many for its very delicate flesh
and agreeable flavour.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa flesus</span> [<i>The Flounder</i>], or as it is called here, the Common
Fluke, and the</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa limanda</span> [<i>The Saltwater Fluke</i>] are also pretty frequent.
In the stomachs of these fish I occasionally find, among other
matters, <i>Tellina fabula</i>, <i>T. tenuis</i>, <i>T. punicea</i> (a most beautiful
little shell), <i>Natica Montagui</i>, <i>N. Alderi</i>, <i>Philine scabra</i>,
<i>Cylichna truncata</i>, <i>C. cylindracea</i>, etc.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa microcephala</span> [<i>The Smooth Dab</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa pola</span> [<i>The Pole Dab</i>] are not so often met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa limandoides</span> [<i>The Yellow or Rough Dab</i>], and the</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Platessa elongata</span> [<i>Long Flounder</i>] are of rare occurrence.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hippoglossus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Halibut</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rhombus maximus</span> [<i>The Turbot</i>] are both met with, inhabiting
deep water. They are seldom taken near the shore. The
former is the more plentiful. The latter is known here as the
Roan Fluke, and always commands a ready sale and a high
price. The other is called the Turbot; and though it sells
well, it is not so valuable as the true turbot, nor yet so eagerly
sought after by the higher classes.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rhombus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Brill or Pearl Turbot</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species is occasionally taken along with the two preceding,
but must rank as rare with us.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rhombus hirtus</span> [<i>Muller’s Topknot</i>] occurs at intervals along our
whole line of coast.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Solea vulgaris</span> [<i>The Sole</i>] is not so common with us as its name
would seem to indicate.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Solea pegusa</span> [<i>The Lemon Sole</i>]. Rare.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Monochirus linguatulus</span> [<i>The Solenette</i>] is of more frequent occurrence.
I have found it in the stomach of the cod and
haddock.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lepidogaster Cornubiensis</span> [<i>The Cornish Sucker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I remember finding a small fish, on one occasion, where our fishermen
clean their lines, and which resembled the above in almost
every particular. It is the only specimen that has come under
my notice.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lepidogaster bimaculatus</span> [<i>The Two-spotted Sucker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Brought on shore, now and then, amongst the refuse entangled in
the fishermen’s lines, and occasionally in old shells, such as
<i>Fusis antiquus</i>, <i>Buccinum undatum</i>, and <i>Cyprina Islandica</i>, etc.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Cyclopterus lumpus</span> [<i>The Lump Sucker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent. Known here by the name of “Paddle Cock.” Not
used as an article of food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Liparis vulgaris</span> [<i>The Unctuous Sucker</i>]. Of partial occurrence.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Liparis Montagui</span> [<i>Montagu’s Sucker</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have only once met with this beautiful little fish here, and that
but lately. It was brought on shore in an old shell. I should
think it rare in the Firth.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anguilla acutirostris</span> [<i>The Sharp-nosed Eel</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Anguilla latirostris</span> [<i>The Broad-nosed Eel</i>] are both found. The
former is the most numerous, and brings the highest price.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Conger vulgaris</span> [<i>The Conger or Great Eel</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This large species is often met with, but is not used as food.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ammodytes Tobianus</span> [<i>The Sand Eel</i>], and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Ammodytes lancea</span> [<i>The Sand Lance</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">The latter the most numerous. Both these are used by our fishermen
for bait.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Syngnathus acus</span> [<i>The Great Pipe Fish</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Syngnathus typhle</span> [<i>The Lesser Pipe-fish</i>] are both met with, and
are accounted by the fishermen to be superior to any other bait.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Syngnathus lumbriciformis</span> [<i>The Worm Pipe-fish</i>] is met with;
and is not so rare as one might expect.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Hippocampus brevirostris.</span></div>

<div class="hang2">This rare and peculiar horse-headed looking creature has been met
with here. Two were found cast on shore at the sands of
Boyndie, near Banff, after a severe sea storm.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Orthagoriscus mola</span> [<i>The Short Sun-fish</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Orthagoriscus oblongus</span> [<i>The Oblong Sun-fish</i>] have been occasionally
met with. Several have been brought on shore by the
fishermen of Gardenstown, Crovie, and other places.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acipenser sturio</span> [<i>The Sturgeon</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Rare. One has been taken in a salmon net.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scyllium canicula</span> [<i>The Small Spotted Dog-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Found occasionally.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Galeus vulgaris</span> [<i>The Tope</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am only aware of two instances in which this fish has been
found within our limits: the one near Buckie, the other in
the bay of Banff.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acanthias vulgaris</span> [<i>The Picked Dog-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Plentiful; often too much so.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scymnus borealis</span> [<i>The Greenland Shark</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">In May 1849 a large specimen of the above shark was captured
by some fishermen belonging to Pennan, off Troup Head. When
brought on shore, it measured thirteen feet nine inches in length,
and eleven feet in circumference where thickest.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Echinorhinus spinosus</span> [<i>The Spinous Shark</i>]. (See <a href="#Page_228">pp. 228</a>, <a href="#Page_231">231</a>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Squatina vulgaris</span> [<i>The Angel Fish</i>], or as it is here called (like
the Angler), “the Sea-devil,” is sometimes procured. A large
specimen was cast into our harbour during the winter of 1851.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Torpedo vulgaris</span> [<i>The Cramp-fish or Electric Ray</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A specimen of this fish is said to have been taken about six miles
off Loggie Head, near Cullen, in 1817. Others are stated as
having been caught.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raia oxyrhynchus</span> [<i>The Sharp-nosed Skate</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Large individuals of this species are sometimes taken, with the
more frequent of our Rays. One measuring upwards of seven
feet in length, and over five in breadth, was captured by our
fishermen some years ago.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raia intermedia</span> [<i>The Flapper Skate</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A small skate, agreeing in many essential points with the flapper,
was taken, in a bag-net set for salmon, some years ago, said to
be a young one of the above species, and as such I include it
here.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raia batis</span> [<i>The Blue or Gray Skate</i>] and</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raia clavata</span> [<i>The Thornback</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Taken, occasionally, In great numbers; the former being the most
numerous and the most prized.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raia radiata</span> [<i>The Starry Ray</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This small species is picked up now and then.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Petromyzon marinus</span> [<i>The Lamprey</i>], or, as it is called here, the
Lamper Eel, is often met with.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Petromyzon fluviatilis</span> [<i>The River Lamprey</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Considered rare. A very fine specimen was taken in the Deveron,
some years since.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Petromyzon Planeri</span> [<i>Planer’s Lamprey or Lampern</i>] has also
occurred. These fish are generally termed “Nine-ee’d Eels,”
and are by no means held in high estimation.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gastrobranchus cæcus</span> [<i>The Myxine or Glutinous Hag</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This very curious and singular animal, whether you call it a fish
or a worm, is of frequent occurrence.</div>


<h4>ADDITIONS.</h4>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Perca fluviatilis</span> [<i>Perch</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several of these fishes have been taken in the Deveron.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trigla Blochii</span> [<i>Bloch’s Gurnard</i>] <i>in the Moray Firth, at Banff</i>.
An example of this gurnard (or, as we call them, “crunacks”)
was captured here in a rock-pool. (See <a href="#Page_281">p. 281</a>.) I am not
aware of the species ever having been detected on this part of
the coast before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Sebastes Norvegicus</span> [<i>Norway Haddock</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One taken off Buckie in 1859 is the only instance of this fish
having been taken on our coasts.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Thynnus pelamys</span> [<i>Stripped Tunny</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A fine specimen of this tunny is in our Museum, taken off Whitehills
in 1867.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Auxis vulgaris</span> [<i>The Plain Bonito</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several of these have now come under my notice. One taken in
a herring-net off Cullen measured over 20 inches in length and
12 in circumference behind the first dorsal. One very peculiar
feature connected with it was, that if stroked down when wet it
gave the hand all the appearance of having come across a piece
of metal newly black-leaded. I am not aware of this peculiarity
being mentioned in Yarrell or elsewhere.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Zeus faber</span> [<i>The Dory</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I have now ascertained that many of these fish have been taken
here, chiefly in salmon-nets. It would seem that the dory
is by no means an uncommon summer visitor on this part of the
coast.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Capros aper</span> [<i>Boar-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">At least one example of this curious-looking fish is now known to
have found its way to our shores. It was taken in a bag-net
near Crovie in August 1862, and was sent here to be stuffed
and named.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Trichiurus lepturus</span> [<i>Silvery Hair-tail or Bald Fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A very fine specimen of this fish, which is rare in the British seas,
and especially on the east coast of Scotland, was found in the
Firth here in April 1876. Although the head and tail were a
good deal injured, it measured over 12 feet in length.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius gracilis</span> [<i>Slender Goby</i>]. Frequent.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius albus</span> [<i>White Goby</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Frequent also. Numbers of these little fish are to be met with in
our rock and sandy pools, whilst others are only to be found at
extreme low water.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Gobius Nilssonii</span> [<i>Nilsson’s Goby</i>]. (See <a href="#Page_375">pp. 375-6</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Labrus Donovani</span> [<i>Donovan’s Wrasse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A specimen of this wrasse was captured in the bay of Boyndie
in August 1863. The fishermen said that there were more,
but they only managed to hook the one, and looked upon it
as a curious species of mackerel. It was mostly of a beautiful
pea-green colour, but striped with numerous yellowish lines.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Labrus microscopicus</span> [<i>Microscopical Wrasse</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It was during the summer of 1861 that I first observed this
minute species. It was not, however, until 1864 that I had an
opportunity of submitting a specimen for examination to some
of our best ichthyologists, amongst whom was Mr. Couch. (See
<a href="#Page_334">p. 334</a>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Tinca vulgaris</span> [<i>Common Tench</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">One specimen taken in our bay in 1864 is the only example I
have seen. It is now in our Museum.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scopelus Humboldtii</span> [<i>Argentine</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This beautiful little creature would seem to be a regular winter
visitor with us. I took it first in January 1863; and, since
then, I have never missed it during that month. It is of
various sizes. I have taken Argentines from under one inch
to about three inches in length. I have never seen them in
summer.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Couchia glauca</span> [<i>The Mackerel Midge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Of all the little fish that I have yet found, this one resembles the
Five-bearded Rockling, more than any of the Midges do the
other Rocklings.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Couchia Thomsoni</span> [<i>Thomson’s Midge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I first took a few of this species in May 1863. They were new
to me, and as I could not find them in Yarrell, nor in other
works of the same kind which I had an opportunity of consulting,
I thought they might prove an undescribed form. Since
that time, however, I have seen Mr. Thomson’s work, and
have now no doubt but that my fish are identical with those
taken by that gentleman in Strangford Lough, County Down,
in July 1838, and named as above. (See <a href="#Page_337">p. 337</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Couchia Montagui</span> [<i>Montagu’s Midge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I first obtained this species in October 1864. (See <a href="#Page_341">p. 341</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Couchia Edwardii</span> [<i>Edward’s Midge</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">First taken at Banff, November 1865. (See <a href="#Page_344">p. 344</a>.)</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Raniceps trifurcatus</span> [<i>Tadpole-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">Several of these are now known to have been found in this part of
the Firth.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rhombus megastoma</span> [<i>The Whiff</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species seems to be rather rare with us. I have a very fine
specimen which I found at the place where our fishermen clean
their lines.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Rhombus arnoglossus</span> [<i>The Scaldfish or Smooth Sole</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This would appear to be another very scarce species with us. I
have never met with it but in fish stomachs, and very seldom
there. It is about the smallest of British flat-fish.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Monochirus variegatus</span> [<i>Variegated Sole</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">This species would appear to be met with occasionally. Two
pretty large ones were exposed for sale in our market in September
1860.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Echiodon Drummondii</span> [<i>Drummond’s Echiodon</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">In March 1863 I took the first specimen of this strange-looking
fish that I had ever seen. Since then, however, I have met with it
several times, and always in winter,—save once, when I obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
it in summer. They were unknown in the Firth before.
Specimens from here are now in the British Museum, London.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acestra æquorea</span> [<i>Equorial Pipe-fish</i>]. This species and the</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Acestra anguinea</span> [<i>Snake Pipe-fish</i>] are both occasionally found.
The latter, however, are seemingly the most frequent.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Chimæra monstrosa</span> [<i>Northern Chimæra</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A specimen of this deep-sea and rather rare species was brought
into our harbour in 1859 on board a herring-boat. It was
found floating, and quite dead. The first dorsal was somewhat
injured, and the cord-like portion of the tail was wanting. It
was unknown to the fishermen who found it, and who, for want
of a better name, called it the “<i>devil</i>.”</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Scyllium melanostomum</span> [<i>Black-mouthed Dog-fish</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">I am led to believe that this species does occasionally occur with
us. It is generally mixed up with the commoner sorts.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Zygæna malleus</span> [<i>Hammer-headed Shark</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A specimen of this strange-looking animal was found dead on the
shore about two miles beyond Whitehills in 1861. It was a
middling-sized specimen, measuring about five feet in length and
about eighteen inches across the head. It had lain some time,
for the skin was blackish, and had the appearance of charred or
burnt leather.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Lamna cornubica</span> [<i>Porbeagle</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">It is now well known that the Porbeagle finds his way here occasionally,
and usually about the herring season. There is a very
fine specimen in our Museum.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Alopias vulpes</span> [<i>The Fox Shark</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">So far as I have been able to learn, this shark appears to be very
rarely met with here. It has, however, been found.</div>

<div class="hang1"><span class="smcap">Notidanus griseus</span> [<i>Brown or Mediterranean Shark</i>].</div>

<div class="hang2">A large specimen of this shark was taken in the Firth here, and

was the site of ancient Aberdeen. For instance, Sir Samuel Forbes
of Foveran, in his <i>Description of Aberdeenshire</i> (1715), says, “From
the end of the last-mentioned straight street [the Upper Kirkgate],
there runs another southward and obliquely [the Nether Kirkgate],
leading also to the town churches, and terminates in a pretty broad
street, lying flat, and called the Green, the seat of the ancient city;
where the river Dee receives a small rivulet, called the Denburn,
covered with a bridge of three arches.”—Turreffs’s <i>Antiquarian
Gleanings</i>, 290.</p></div>

pigs? He could not have climbed over the paling; he must have
been lifted over. There was an old sweetheart of the quondam
militiaman, whom he had deserted in favour of Margaret Mitchell.
It was believed that she had maliciously lifted the child over the
palings, and put him amongst the pigs, most probably from spite
against her old lover.</p></div>

of Glen Avon, Banffshire, is thus described in the <i>New Statistical
Account of Scotland</i>. “The eagle builds its eyrie in some inaccessible
rock, and continues from year to year to hatch its young in the
same spot. One of these noble birds was killed some years ago,
which measured upwards of six feet from tip to tip of the wings.
One of the keepers of the forest being one day reclining on the side
of a hill, observed an eagle hovering about for his prey, and, darting
suddenly down, it caught hold of a polecat, with which it rose up,
and flew away in the direction of an immense cliff on the opposite
hill. It had not proceeded far, when he observed it abating its
course, and descending in a spiral direction, until it reached the
ground. He was led by curiosity to proceed towards the spot,
which was about a mile distant from him, and there he found the
eagle quite dead, with its talons transfixed in the polecat. The
polecat was also dead, with its teeth fixed in the eagle’s gullet.”</p></div>

the population; but the churchyard at Old Aberdour is still used
as the parish burying-ground. Nothing can be more disgraceful
than the state of some of the country burying-places in Scotland.
The graves at Aberdour are covered with hemlocks and nettles!
And yet some money seems to have been spent in “ornamenting”
the place. The ruins of the ancient church have actually been
“harled”—that is, bespattered with a mixture of lime and gravel!
Think of “harling” Melrose Abbey! The money spent in whitewashing
the ruins would certainly have been better expended in
removing the bits of old coffins, cutting down the hemlocks and
nettles, and putting the burying-ground into better order. The
Queen has shown a good example in ordering the churchyard of
Crathie to be improved. But that of Braemar is still in a wretched
state, being covered with hemlocks and nettles.</p></div>

the poor spiders may console themselves with the honour of martyrdom
as justly as the innumerable frogs, who betrayed, amid
their tortures, the mystery of galvanism. In this, as in other
things, people have obtained a very different and perhaps more
important result than they had expected. It appears that though
spiders do not turn to diamonds, they can live a long time without
food. An insect of this species, inclosed in a box for this rational
purpose, was found alive after the poor sufferer had been forgotten
for five years.”—<i>Ackermann’s Repository</i>, January 1815.</p></div>

for “kindling.” He never had the least idea that old letters could be
useful. When the author made inquiry about them, Edward said,
“I fear there will be a great blank there. I am not aware when I
began to correspond; and as for keeping letters, I had no reason
for that; still, I may have some, and I will try and find them.”
After about a week, he said, “I have found no old letters yet; but
my wife tells me that she saw a box, about two years ago, in an old
lumber garret, which she thinks may contain some useless old papers
of mine. I will try and get it out, and make a search. I might have
had many hundreds, if not thousands, if I had kept them. The postman,
as well as my master and shopmates, were all surprised at the
great number of letters I received for many years.” At last the box
in the garret was discovered, and a small collection of letters was
found in it, which the author has made use of in writing the
latter part of this Memoir.</p></div>

<p>“<i>If I had read this look when I was a young man, my life would have been very different.</i>”—Such
was the remark made to me by a friend on returning Smiles’s ‘Self-Help,’
which I had given him to read. I was very much struck by the observation;
and while thinking of the immense effect which this incomparable book has produced
in England, and of the universally favourable reception which the Italian translation
has received in this country, I received a letter from signor G. Barbèra, in which he
invited me to write a book similar to the English one, but illustrated by Italian
examples. I was much astonished at his thinking me equal to the work: but his
valuable suggestion greatly delighted me, and I accepted his proposal with much cordiality.“—<span class="smcap">Michele
Lessona</span>, in <i>Volere è Potere</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Volere è Potere</i>’ (‘Will is power’). Such is the title of a very interesting popular
work just issued by the eminent Florentine publisher, G. Barbèra. The history of
this production is rather curious. It may not be known that the most remarkable
literary success achieved of late years in Italy (where literary successes are the rarest
of all events) has fallen to the lot of Mr. Samuel Smiles’s admirable ‘Self-Help,’ an
Italian version of which, published some time ago at Milan, has since gone through
several editions, and still appears to be in continual demand. The idea of the book
was a novelty for Italians, and the moral which it inculcates one so eminently deserving
of being enforced upon all classes of the public of Italy, that the question soon
arose whether it would not be advisable to extend the sphere of its utility by promoting
the publication of a similar book, specially designed for Italian readers, and in which
the examples of patient industry and of untiring perseverance in the pursuit of a fixed
design should be drawn from home materials. An association founded in Florence
with the express object of stimulating the educational movement among the people,
offered a prize of 3000f. for the best production of the kind, and all the literary men of
Italy were invited to compete. M. Lessona, an agreeable writer upon popular subjects,
has already entered the lists, and printed his work (‘Volere è Potere’) without
waiting for the award of the committee appointed to decide between the rival competitors.”—<i>Standard.</i></p>

Platon définissait le beau la splendeur du vrai,—tel est le caractère qui distingue surtout
‘Self-Help.’ Ce livre, si populaire chez nos voisins, répond admirablement aux
idées de la famille anglo-saxonne. Recevra-t-il chez nous le même accueil? Je l’espère,
mais il aura aussi, je le crains, plus d’un vieux préjugé à combattre. En France,
n’a-t-on point trop compté sur les institutions politiques malgré la durée éphémère des
gouvernements? L’État peut faire du premier venu un ministre; il ne saurait en faire
un grand homme, il même un fonctionnaire intègre et capable. Il est donc bon de
chercher à d’autres sources ces énergies morales qui développent et régénèrent les
sociétés.”—<i>Revue des Deux Mondes.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles’s book is wise beyond the wisdom of any but a very few books that we
have read. The chapter on the use and abuse of money we must commend to the
reader’s own perusal. It is pregnant with practical wisdom, and contains, besides,
some excellent remarks upon the improvidence of the working classes, and upon the
evils entailed by the pursuit of vulgar ‘respectability’ among their so-called superiors.
‘Self-Help’ is one of the soundest, wisest, most instructive, and most wholesome
works we have opened for a long time.”—<i>Leader.</i></p>

<div class="adtitle2">THRIFT:</div>

<div class="center"><br />A BOOK OF DOMESTIC COUNSEL.<br />
————————</div>


<p>“There is no book among the current literature of the day we would rather see in a
young man’s hand than this. Although every person in his daily experience must meet
with many instances of the folly of unthrift, especially among the poorer classes, the
frequency of the text, and it is to be feared the disposition of the age, render the lesson
valueless. Domestic economy as an art and a science is an unstudied subject, and one
few writers have deemed worthy of their thoughts. We cannot therefore feel sufficiently
thankful that the able writer of ‘Self-Help’ has turned his attention to it, and endeavoured,
in language that has not only a literary charm about it, but bears the stamp of
philanthropic earnestness, to rouse the interest, and thereby the reflection of the British
public, in so important a matter of national welfare. The dignity of labour, the necessity
of inducing habits of saving, the wickedness of extravagant living, the dangers of prosperity,
and the want of sympathy between employers and employed, are topics on which
Mr. Smiles speaks hard, and it may be unpleasant truths, accompanied by a fund of
illustration. Perhaps no part of the book is so valuable as the dissipation of the superstitious
belief in goad-luck, and the chapter on the art of living. We trust the work
will be found in every village and public library, that its principles may be disseminated
broadcast among our youth; and we can assure all that they may enjoy in it many an
hour’s pleasant and profitable reading.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“In Mr. Smiles’ latest book he gives us something more than an illustrative treatise
on that homely and excellent virtue, Thrift. He deals with some of the leading social
questions of the day, such as Co-operation and Association. He sketches the sanitary
movement unsparingly, satirises the feminine follies of fashionable circles, and lastly
concludes with an admirable essay on what may be called the æsthetics of common life.
We all know what a book from Mr. Smiles is sure to be, anecdotical, practical, and
abounding in good sense and every-day wisdom,—a book that is sure to entertain the
old and instruct the young.”—<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles has produced an interesting volume. His pages bristle with sage precepts
and with admirable illustrations of the virtue he has undertaken to inculcate on
his countrymen. There is no doubt ample room for a judicious homily on Thrift. The
wealth of England was never so great as at this time, and the thoughtless improvidence
of Englishmen was never so conspicuous. Mr. Smiles complains, as well he may, of the
monstrous folly of highly-paid artizans, who spend half their wages in selfish pleasure;
and he shows that the large gains of such men are no proof of prosperity, as they do but
add to their thriftlessness, and serve to gratify animal indulgences. Money, like political
power, in the hands of uncultivated men, is certain to be abused.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the whole,
Mr. Smiles’ volume is marked by sound good sense, tersely and vigorously expressed.
There are few readers who will not gain from it more than one useful lesson; and to young
men it may prove specially serviceable.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“In writing one more good book, in these days when much that is worthless in literature
finds favour with the masses, Mr. Smiles has added permanency to the lustre of a
name which has long been a ‘household word’ amongst us, and entitled himself to the
renewed thanks of every one who is interested in the prosperity, the happiness, and the
well-being of the community.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. May the lesson he teaches be deeply grafted in the
minds of the rising generation, to whom more especially we commend the careful perusal
and study of the work now before us.”—<i>Derby Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles has done something in the concluding pages of this volume to give us the
supplement which many people have thought was lacking to his teaching. They are full
of the highest thought, replete with generous sentiment, based on the true conception
of man as a being who only begins his life here below.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The book in several
ways supplements the former ones; and it is in one respect, at least, superior to
them.”—<i>Nonconformist.</i></p>

<div class="adtitle2">CHARACTER:</div>

<div class="center"><br />A COMPANION VOLUME TO ‘SELF-HELP’ AND ‘THRIFT’.<br />
————————</div>



<p>“This work is so exactly fitted for a gift-book (and indeed a school-boy or a boy
leaving school need desire no better one) that we are inclined to mention it here. The
value of character above all mere intellectual culture, the blessedness of work, the
necessity of courage and self-control, the sense of duty as the guiding star of life—these
are some of the topics discussed in ‘Character,’—not, however, as abstract propositions,
but with the help of a store of illustrations drawn from the biographies of great men.
The book possesses, if we may use the expression, a <i>vital</i> force, and can scarcely fail
to stimulate the reader. The chapters headed ‘Companionship of Books,’ and
‘Companionship in Marriage,’ will be read with special interest.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“To the lovers of a pure and healthy literature, this invigorating and high-toned
volume from the pen of the author of ‘Self-Help’ will afford real and genuine enjoyment.
In the clear and attractive style which has rendered his previous writings so deservedly
popular, Mr. Smiles has here shown to what a height of mental and moral excellence our
weak and imperfect nature may attain, and how much true nobility of character it may
develop and sustain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The last two chapters, on Companionship in Marriage and
the Discipline of Experience, form a fitting conclusion to so excellent a book, and are
pregnant with interest and lessons of the highest wisdom. The breadth and soundness of
the views enunciated in the former on some delicate but universally important topics are
especially commendable, and should be read and pondered over by all who see a much-neglected
source of happiness for the people in the elevation of their home-life, and a
more extensive cultivation of the domestic virtues.”—<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p>

<p>“Uniform in size with the author’s very popular ‘Self-Help,’ this work is of the same
tone and cast of thought. Believing that character is a great power in the world, the
author treats the various points in which it may be developed, or which call it forth.
Hence, we have chapters on Home Power, Companionship, Temper, Marriage, Experience,
and abundant citations of examples, so that the work is full of interest. It is
difficult indeed to limit the good that may arise from these honest, earnest books, full of
right thinking; plain, sensible, and not too full of sentiment.”—<i>Publishers’ Circular.</i></p>

<p>“Readers of ‘Self-Help’ will need no further inducement to send them in search of
the new work by the author of that charming book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would be difficult to select
a book more admirably adapted as a present to a young man or young woman at the
outset of life. The charm of the style is irresistible; the moral conveyed altogether
unimpeachable.”—<i>Manchester Courier.</i></p>

<p>“The author of ‘Self-Help’ has produced another little book which will soon run over
the face of the land, and help to inspire the rising generation with ennobling sentiments.
In our hunger for facts, we must not overlook the value of ideas. While we are striving
to give our young people technical information, we must not omit to teach them to be
truthful, high-thoughted, noble men and women. We must foster their abilities, but not
forget Character.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Smiles, in this very charming volume, has brought together
the opinions and sayings of good and wise men of all times, as to the various qualities
which go to form character.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The result is a valuable book, calculated as well to
give delight as to do good.”—<i>Builder.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles has been fortunate in the choice of his subject: and, as a work of wise
counsel and thoughtful instruction, the new book is quite as successful as any of its
author’s previous works. Nor is it any less entertaining. It literally teems with apposite
and interesting anecdotes, and the writer’s style is at once so lively and dignified, that on
the one hand he never becomes dry however earnestly and seriously he discusses life and
duty; and, on the other, he never degenerates into flippancy in his most amusing illustrations.”—<i>Manchester
Examiner.</i></p>

<div class="adtitle2">INDUSTRIAL BIOGRAPHY:</div>

<div class="center"><br />IRON-WORKERS AND TOOL-MAKERS.<br />
————————</div>


<p>“Mr. Smiles has hit upon a rich vein of ore, and works it with great success. He
has the art of biography, which is by no means so easy of attainment as, judging from
the number of persons who attempt this species of composition, one would imagine it to
be. Memoirs are countless, but the number of biographies that can be accepted as successful
works of art are very few indeed. Mr. Smiles is not only a skilful workman, he
has chosen a new field of work. Hitherto the great biographies have been written of
soldiers and sailors, and statesmen, poets and artists, and philosophers. It would seem
as if these only were the great men of the world, as if these only were the benefactors of
mankind, whose deeds are worthy of memory. The suspicion has arisen that, after all,
there may be other heroes than those of the pen, the sceptre, and the sword. There are,
indeed, men in various walks of life whose footsteps are worthy of being traced; but,
surely, considering what England is, and to what we owe most of our material greatness,
the lives of our Engineers are peculiarly worthy of being written. ‘The true Epic of our
time,’ says Mr. Carlyle, ‘is not Arms and the man, but Tools and the man—an infinitely
wider kind of Epic.’ Our machinery has been the making of us; our iron-works have,
in spite of the progress of other nations, still kept the balance in our hands. Smith-work
in all its branches of engine-making, machine-making, tool-making, cutlery, iron ship-building,
and iron-working generally, is our chief glory. England is the mistress of
manufactures, and so the queen of the world, because it is the land of smith; and Mr.
Smiles’s biographies are a history of the great family of smith. Many of the facts which
he places before us are wholly new, and are derived from the most likely sources.
Thus, Maudslay’s partner Mr. Joshua Field, and his pupil Mr. Nasmyth, supplied the
materials for his biography. Mr. John Penn supplied the chief material for the memoir
of Clement, and so of the other memoirs; though they necessarily go over much well-trodden
ground, they contain also much original information, expressed with great clearness,
and with a practised skill which renders the reader secure of entertainment in
every page.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“This is not a very large book, but it is astonishing how much individual, conscientious,
and thoroughly original search has been required for its composition, and how
much interesting matter it contains which we possess in no other form. Mr. Smiles
rescues no name, but many histories, from oblivion. His heroes are known and gratefully
remembered for the benefits they have conferred on mankind, but our knowledge
of our benefactors has hitherto been mostly confined to our knowledge of the benefit.
It was reserved for Mr. Smiles to discover in the workshop, heroes as true as ever hurled
their battalions across a battle-field, and to present us with much-enduring, much-endeavouring,
and brave men, where hitherto we had been content with disembodied,
almost meaningless names. The present work is further distinguished, not indeed
from its predecessors, but from much of the current literature, by the exquisitely
pellucid English, the vigorous but unobtrusive style, in which the narratives are conveyed,
the value of the work before us is doubled, and the time required for perusing,
and especially for consulting it halved, by the full and minute index in which its contents
are tabulated.”—<i>Edinburgh Daily Review.</i></p>

<p>“This is one of the most delightful books we have ever read. It is at once practical,
instructive, and suggestive. Whoever wishes to benefit his young friends will present
them every one with a copy of this book. Whatever struggling mechanic who, feeling
that there is something beyond what he now knows or can execute, yet hesitates or
fears, let him read this book. It is a sovereign panacea for doubt or cowardice. Whoever
takes delight in watching the development of knowledge and in ascertaining the
sources of the privileges which surround him, let him possess himself of this book, and
we can promise him a treat of no ordinary character.”—<i>Sheffield Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<div class="adtitle2">LIFE OF GEORGE STEPHENSON,</div>

<div class="center"><br />INCLUDING A MEMOIR OF HIS SON ROBERT STEPHENSON.<br />
<br /><i>Illustrated with Two Steel Portraits, and numerous Engravings
on Wood.</i><br />
————————</div>


<p>“It is a singular fate that some of the world’s greatest benefactors should pass from
the world with their history comparatively unnoticed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we rightly rejoice
when the claims of any of them are vindicated—when, from the hidden company of the
Brindleys and Watts, men risen from the ranks to do world-wide service, and incidently
to be the architects of their country’s later greatness, we can obtain the
authentic history of such a creator as George Stephenson. It is not too much to say,
that by Mr. Smiles, who has performed this office with eminent success, a considerable
void is filled up in the page of modern history. We see the vast proportions of our
modern achievements, and the epic story of this age of iron, more than half comprised
in the feats of its strongest and most successful worker. The worker himself, with his
noble simplicity and energy, his zeal for his kind, his native-born gentleness, and
indomitable tenacity, would probably have been eminent in any age or condition of
society; but, in virtue of his actual achievements and the obstacles he surmounted, of
his struggles and triumphs, we may designate him a hero, and ask, in defence of this
arbitrary title, what real conditions of heroism were wanting?”—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“We have read this book with unmingled satisfaction. We hardly ever remember to
have read a biography so thoroughly unaffected. There is no pushing forward of the
author himself—he never comes between us and his subject. The book is an artless
attempt to set out the character and career of one of the most ingenuous, honest,
resolute, homely, and kind-hearted of human beings. We thank Mr. Smiles for having
made the man walk before us in a most life-like picture. The entire style of the work is
unambitious, lucid, thoroughly manly, and good.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“We should like to see this biography in the hands of all our young men. One
breathes a healthy, bracing atmosphere in reading this book. It sets before us a fine
instance of success in life attained purely in the exercise of genuine qualities. There was
no sham about George Stephenson.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was a great and good man, and we can
give the ‘Life’ no higher praise than to say that it is worthy of its subject. Mr. Smiles
is so anxious to place the character and career of Stephenson justly before his readers,
that he quite forgets himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We do not know that there ever lived an individual
to whom each separate inhabitant of Great Britain owes so much of real tangible
advantage.”—<i>Fraser’s Magazine.</i></p>

<p>“It is the fate of few men, even of those who are the most signal public benefactors,
to be known and appreciated by the generation in which they live. The fame of George
Stephenson spread slowly, and, great as it has at last become, we cannot question that
it will continue to increase with time. Not only is he a surprising example of a labourer
raising himself to wealth and eminence without one solitary advantage except what he
derived from his own genius; but the direction which that genius took has stamped his
name upon the most wonderful achievement of our age.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He died, leaving behind
him the highest character for simplicity, kindness of heart, and absolute freedom from
all sordidness of disposition. His virtues are very beautifully illustrated, and by no
means exaggerated, in his Life by Mr. Smiles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is scarcely a single page of
the work which is not suggestive, and on which it would not be profitable to institute
inquiry into the results of past experience as compared with present practice. The
whole ground is novel, and of the highest interest.”—<i>Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p>“The author of the Railway System—already adopted in every civilised country, and
everywhere bringing forward vast social changes—is the real hero of the half-century.
This instructive and deeply interesting story of his youth will contribute to keep alive
the hopes, incite the perseverance, encourage the industry, and form the mind of after
generations. It is one of the tales which ‘the world will not willingly let die.’ The
realities of Stephenson’s life, which till now have found no biographer, are more
astounding than the fancies of even Eastern poets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His life is an admirable model
for youth, supplied by one of the working multitude, while his exertions will help to
relieve them from the extraordinary difficulties which he had to surmount.”—<i>Economist.</i></p>

————————</div>



<p>“A chapter of English history which had to be written, and which, probably, no
one could have written so well. Mr. Smiles has obtained a mass of original materials.
It is not too much too say that we now have an Engineers’ Pantheon, with a connected
narrative of their successive reclamations from sea, bog, and fen; a history of the
growth of the inland communication of Great Britain by means of its roads, bridges,
canals, and railways; and a survey of the lighthouses, breakwaters, docks, and harbours
constructed for the protection and accommodation of our commerce with the
world.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“We cannot but refer in passing to the captivating and instructive volumes which
Mr. Smiles has devoted to the ‘Lives of the Engineers,’ a record not before attempted
of the achievements of a race of men who have conferred the highest honour and the
most extensive benefits on their country. ‘Who are the great men of the present age?’
said Mr. Bright in the House of Commons,—‘Not your warriors—not your statesmen;
they are your Engineers.’”—<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles has profoundly studied, and has happily delineated in his lucid and
instructive biographies, that remarkable succession of gifted minds which has, not by
lucky guesses, but by incessant labour and by lifelong thought, gradually erected that
noble example of dominion of man over the earth—the science of Engineering; and we
are proud to know that there are men yet among us who can wield the arms of the
invincible knights of old, and who will leave no meaner memory behind them.”—<i>Quarterly
Review.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles may fairly claim the merit of having produced one of the most interesting
and instructive works. He has discovered almost unbroken ground, and has
worked it with so much skill and success, that his readers will recognise in his
volumes an illustration of the truth of Lord Macaulay’s saying, that history, personal
or national, may, when properly written, be rendered as interesting as any novel.”—<i>London
Review.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>“In tracing the history of English engineering from the beginning, Mr. Smiles
really gives a history of English civilisation. He has produced a kind of philosophical
biography, the progress of discovery and industrial conquest having necessarily a
general correspondence with the mental development of the great representatives of
man’s external action. We think Mr. Smiles has done what was well worth the doing,
with skill, with honesty, with purpose, and with taste.”—<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p>“There may be many here who have made themselves acquainted with a book that
cannot be too widely brought into public notice—I mean the recent publication of a
popular author, Mr. Smiles, entitled ‘The Lives of the Engineers.’ There may be
those here who have read the Life of Brindley, and perused the record of his discouragement
in the tardiness of his own mind, as well as in the external circumstances
with which he determined to do battle, and over which he achieved his triumph.
There may be those who have read the exploits of the blind Metcalfe, who made roads
and bridges in England at a time when nobody else had learned to make them. There
may be those who have dwelt with interest on the achievements of Smeaton, Rennie,
and Telford. In that book we see of what materials Englishmen are made. These
men, who have now become famous among us, had no mechanics’ institute, no libraries,
no classes, no examinations to cheer them on their way. In the greatest poverty,
difficulties, and discouragements, their energies were found sufficient for their work,
and they have written their names in a distinguished page of the history of their
country.”—<i>The Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone at Manchester.</i></p>

<p>“I have just been reading a work of great interest, which I recommend to your
notice—I mean Smiles’s ‘Lives of the Engineers.’ No more interesting books have
been published of late years than those of Mr. Smiles—his ‘Lives of the Engineers,’
his ‘Life of George Stephenson,’ and his admirable little book on ‘Self-Help’—a most
valuable manual.”—<i>The Right Hon. Sir Stafford Northcote at Exeter.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles has done wisely to link the names of Boulton and Watt together in the
volume before us. The more we read of the correspondence between these two great
men during the birth of the new motive power, the more we feel convinced that the
world has to be thankful for their happy partnership. Boulton seemed by some happy
chance to possess all the qualities of mind that were wanting in Watt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From the
heaps of dusty ledgers in the counting—house at Soho, the author has drawn the
materials for these deeply-interesting lives, and has so handled them as to produce a
volume which worthily crowns his efforts in this most interesting, because before
untrodden, walk in literature.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“Boulton was the complement of Watt’s active intelligence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His is a memory
of which the leaders of industry in Great Britain may well be proud. His virtues were
the common virtues which render the English character respected throughout the
world, but in him they were combined with admirable harmony, and were unsullied by
any of those vices which too frequently degrade the reputation of our countrymen.
We cannot read of Mr. Boulton’s grand struggle to bring the steam-engine into further
use without a feeling of pure admiration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We lay down this volume with a feeling
of pride and admiration that England had the honour of producing at the same time
two such men, whose labours will continue to benefit mankind to the remotest generation,
and with gratitude to the distinguished biographist who preserves for the instruction
of the times to come, pictures of them so full of life and reality.”—<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“That Mr. Smiles’s will be the standard life of the great engineer is simply the
necessity of his greater art as an industrial biographer. His skill in weaving together
anecdote and description, representations of what was known with a distinct specification
of what was contributed by his hero; his dramatic power, in this volume especially,
exhibited in the contrast of the two partners,—the sanguine, speculative character of
Boulton; the anxious, morbid, cautious temper of Watt,—one full of hope in the very
darkest circumstances, the other full of fear in the brightest,—give the volume a wonderful
charm. The life of Watt is a great epic of discovery: the narrative of it by Mr.
Smiles is an artistic and finished poem.”—<i>British Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p>“We venture to think that this, Mr. Smiles’s most recent work, will achieve even a
higher popularity than those which have preceded it. We are impressed by this book
with the fact that hitherto, however highly public speakers and writers may have lauded
Watt and his achievements, the general public have really known little or nothing of
this great man’s history, life, and character. These are admirably and graphically
depicted in the volume before us; in the preparation of which the author appears to
have had access to a vast mass of authentic documents, of which he has made excellent
use.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p>“The cunning of Mr. Smiles’s hand never fails him. He has chosen the prosaic
side of Huguenot history, and has made it as fascinating as a romance. He has not
essayed to depict the religious heroism or the social tragedy of the Huguenot story—he
has restricted himself to the economical influence of its migrations, and he has
made the statistics and genealogies—of which his work is full—as interesting as
Homer’s lists of ships and heroes, or as Milton’s array of the demigods of hell. The
process seems very simple and easy, but it can be saved from utter dreariness only by
consummate art. Mr. Smiles has pursued his investigations with a laborious minuteness
worthy of the Statistical Society and of the Heralds’ College; and yet it is as
impossible to skip a page, as in reading his life of Stephenson.”—<i>British Quarterly.</i></p>

<p>“Avec un rare déssintéressement national et un sentiment de justice qu’on ne saurait
trop encourager, un écrivain Anglais vient aujourd’hui rendre aux étrangers ce
que la riche et laborieuse Angleterre du xix<sup>me</sup> siecle doit aux étrangers. M. Smiles
est l’historien de la vapeur et de toutes les découvertes utiles; ses héros sont les inventeurs,
les artisans célèbres, les ingénieurs, tous ceux, en un mot, qui out dérobé á
la nature un secret ou un force pour étendre le règne de l’homme sur la matière. Les
conquêtes de l’industrie et du commerce le préoccupent bien autrement que les victoires
des armées Anglaises.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Par la tournure de ses idées et l’ordre de ses études,
M. Smiles était done préparé à traiter cet interessant sujet,—la naissance des arts utiles
chez un grand peuple qui, à l’origine, n’avait pas d’industrie.”—<i>Revue des Deux Mondes.</i></p>

<p>“The work of Mr. Smiles embraces a subject which has never been adequately
treated, at least in English literature—the history, namely, of the French and Flemish
Protestant refugees in this country, and their descendants.</p>

<p>“Of the powerful influence exercised by this immigration on our industry, commerce,
arts, literature, even our usages and modes of thought, few are aware. The
subject is by no means a familiar one among ourselves. The whole revolution, so to
speak, took place so gradually, the new population amalgamated so readily and thoroughly
with the old, that people hardly attached to the phenomena which passed
under their eyes their real importance. Mr. Smiles’s account of it is, therefore, admirably
calculated to impart, not only new knowledge, but really new ideas, to most of us.</p>

<p>“To readers who love to dwell on heroic vicissitudes rather than on mere details of
economical progress, Mr. Smiles’s account of the persecution in France, the sufferings
of the many and the marvellous escapes of the few, will prove the most attractive part
of his work.</p>

<p>“How this noble army of emigrants for conscience sake—the truest aristocracy,
perhaps, which has ever developed itself—gradually and peacefully amalgamated with
that mass of the English people which they had done so much to enrich and to instruct,
Mr. Smiles has fully shown. He recounts their euthanasia, if such it may be
termed, as he does their rise. To one of the great causes of their success, and not in
England only, he does ample justice. They were, as a body, extremely well educated;
and they jealously transmitted that inheritance, which they had brought from France,
to their children. The poorest Huguenot refugee was almost always a cultivated man.
Hence their great advantage in the fair race of industry.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smiles’s book on the ‘Huguenots’ is an improvement on anything he has yet
done, and it deserves a success which, by reason of its very merits, we fear it has no
chance of attaining. The subject breaks ground that may almost be called fallow.
Many chapters of English history, and these not the least interesting or important, are
for the first time written, with the care and breadth they deserve, by Mr. Smiles.”—<i>London
Review.</i></p>
